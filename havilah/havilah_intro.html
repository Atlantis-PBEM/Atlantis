  The Eternal City, home of the Maker, has stood forever, infinite
  and glorious.  But where there is freedom there may be dissent,
  and some, seeking their own sovereignty, rose up against their
  Maker.  These rebels were cast out of the Eternal City, although
  none know for sure whether this was punishment or release.

  You are one of these outcasts, and find yourself in an unknown land.
  Will you seek to redeem yourself and return to your home?  Or will
  you forget the past in favour of your own pursuit of knowledge, power
  or glory?  The choice is yours.

  This instance of Atlantis is a semi-open-ended computer moderated
  fantasy game for any number of players.  Players may attempt to carve
  out huge empires, become master magicians, intrepid explorers, rich
  traders or any other career that comes to mind.
  Each player can set their own objectives, and new players can join at
  any time.
  Individual factions may win the game by somehow managing to return to
  the Eternal City, but if they do so the game will continue without
  them for all those who are still trying to achieve this goal, or who
  have no intention of doing so.
  There are also rumours in dark places of a blasphemy so vile that it
  could sever the connection between Havilah and the Eternal City
  forever...
