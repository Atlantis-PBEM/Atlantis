  In the beginning were the Two Hundred Elder Gods. They ruled the
  cosmos and the world of Wyreth with an iron grip, subjugating man and
  animal alike to their whims.
</P>
<P>
  Some of the men were given powers making them like gods themselves.
  The sorcerors, the necromancers, the wizards and the priests. Mages
  of all ilk were the favored of the gods, since they had the powers to
  drain power from their fellow beings and channel that energy to their
  patron.
</P>
<P>
  In the Year of Redemption, one Mage, Alterion The Just, threw off the
  yoke of his patron and with the help of the Council of Twenty cast the
  Elder Gods into the Abyss.
</P>
<P>
  Much time has passed since the Year of Redemption, and much of the old
  knowledge has been lost.
</P>
<P>
  Long lost scrolls fortold the return of the Elder Gods, but these
  prophecies had been forgotton in the annals of history save by a
  select few.
</P>
<P>
  The time of prophecy has come. The initial signs of the return of
  the Elder Gods have appeared. First came the famine that raged
  through the world and killed off most of the population. Then came
  the pestilence. And finally, the Blood Moon. Now warlords and mages
  have arisen to try to give some semblance of order to the chaotic
  world.
</P>
<P>
  You are one of these new leaders, cast adrift in a hostile world.
  Will you work to keep the elder gods contained by finding and slaying
  their earthly avatars and guarding the Black Keep which is spoken of
  in the ancient scrolls?  Or will you return to the worship of the
  Elder Gods of your ancestors and seek to protect them and slay those
  who would banish them?  Will you ignore the entire struggle in favor
  of your own personal pursuit of knowledge, power or glory. The choice
  is yours.

  This instance of Atlantis is a semi-open-ended computer moderated
  fantasy game for any number of players.  Players may attempt to carve
  out huge empires, become master magicians, intrepid explorers, rich
  traders or any other career that comes to mind.  Should any player
  find the Black Keep, slay all of the avatars of the Elder Gods, and
  guard the hex containing the keep, that faction will be declared the
  winner and cause the ending of the game (While only one faction may
  actually claim the title of 'winner', it is expected that the defeat
  of the avatars of the Elder Gods will require the effort of an
  alliance of factions). However, each player can set their own
  objectives and it is truly up to the player if they wish to help,
  hinder, or ignore the struggle to contain the Elder Gods.  Players
  may (of course) join at any time.
