   -- GIVE ALL TRADE (to give away all trade goods) (other categories for
      other obvious flags) (maybe.. there are issues with this)
   -- BUY ALL/SELL ALL
   -- Improve the item/hex editor
   -- Gamedef to handle various options around combat/weapons/bows for taxing
   -- Gamedefs for various economy options. (far future)
   -- Add option to allow towers/forts/etc to allow training only a certain
      number of mages.
   -- Consider more complicated GIVE processing of 'GIVE ALL EXCEPT .....'
   -- Consider requiring both food and pay for upkeep (make upkeep more
      flexible in general).  Someone supplied a patch to allow a leader to
      only eat 1 (grain/livestock/fish) instead of 1 per 10 SILV upkeep.
      That would be a nice option to support as well, but to do so (as well)
      as allow old behaviour requires flexibility.
   -- Merchent skill (limited number of merchents)/Limited number
      of tacticians/generals?
   -- Make errors for overwriting orders ONLY be an error if overwriting a
      NON-@ order.
   -- Consider some sorts of dangers for production
   -- Consider a gamedef which keeps tactics skill (and combat skills?)
      hidden from combatants.  (I personally think this a bad idea, but it
      was suggested, thus goes on this list)
   -- Consider hiding battle details from units which are completely wiped
      out?  [You know a battle occured, but no details of the enemy forces].
      Again, I suspect rumors travel (ie, the peasants in the area that saw
      the battle talk and the word of their strenght spreads).   Given that
      generating *inaccurate* reports would be a royal pain, I will probably
      leave this be.
   -- Consider allowing luxury food items (chocolate, vodka, cavier) to be
      able to be eaten.  Again, don't think this is a good idea, but will
      at least think on it.
   -- Consider adding the ability to produce trade goods.
   -- Consider Duergar's war horses
   -- Consider building specific skills.
   -- Consider non-teachable skills.
   -- Consider having use'd items.
   -- Need a tool which given template files and globals structures can
      build an accurate rules set.
   -- Consider tools for increasing building (and ship) production.
   -- Consider skill improvement through use.
   -- I'd like to add some code that will do a bit of validation on a
      rule-set, and make sure it isn't broken.
   -- FindDeadFactions is possibly inefficient.
   -- Add more info to battle reports.
   -- Unit grouping.
   -- Issue orders for turns in the future (extension of the @ system).
      My thoughts here are to introduce a 'turn' order, that means
      everything after the turn order should be delayed for a turn (by
      just putting it into next turn's template, instead of executing
      it). Multiple 'turn' orders can be used to give orders arbitrarily
      into the future. 'turn' can be combined with @ to creating loops.
      (Dunno if this or Tzargs way is the 'correct' way to handle this)
   -- Handle spell damages generically.
   -- Handle speed increase from summon wind configurably.
   -- Add more items so that apprentices are actually useful.
   -- rethink some of the current spells.
   -- consider having summoned creatures drop no loot. Possibly have
      them regain (or gain) loot over time, so the longer a monster is free
      the more money and stuff it has.
   -- Consider Az's beastform spell
   -- 'This item can be found in....' information.
   -- Add option for entertain being an instant order.
   -- Consider having allied units tagged as a '+' instead of a '-'. (extend
      to all different stances).
   -- Make that unit tagging a player option.
   -- Add a 'MAINTAINONLY' flag to buildings so that a building can decay and
      be kept up, but cannot be constructed. (requested for Ceran)
   -- Consider multiple levels of guard

TODO for 5.0.0
----------------------------------------------
   -- Ben Lloyd's class system should go in (probably wait on 5.0.0)
   -- Move String and List over to using a STL implementation
