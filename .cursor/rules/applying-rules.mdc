# Application of Rules

## Precedence
- If two rules contradict, use the more specific one
  - If the conflict can be logically resolved, resolve it
    - Inform the user of the conflict and the resolution
    - Give the user an opportunity to correct you if you get the resolution wrong

## Notification
- Always inform the user what rules are being applied
- Always inform the user when rules are re-evaluated.

## Re-evaluation
- Re-evaluate rules for inclusion and activation whenever new information is added
- Creating a new file or changing a file requires reevaluations.
- A new query, even in the same session, requires reevaluation.
