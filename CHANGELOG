Changes from 4.0.5 -> 4.0.6
--------------------------------------------------
   -- Added FIND ALL command supplied by Tzarg (Tom Alsen)
   -- Reworked enabling/disabling of items to better preserve old feel.
   -- Various small bugfixes.
   -- Added worldname to the gamedefs structure (used for creating the
      names for the nexus and oceans as well as some spell texts)
   -- Added NEXUS_GATE gamedef to allow a one-way gate directly out of the
      nexus via gate lore.   There is no actual gate so people cannot in
      fact return to the nexus once leaving.
   -- Added code to make a starting city into just a rich city (with
      limited items available) if the city guards are taken out when
      SAFE_START_CITIES is false.   Once this occurs the unlimited goods
      are gone for good.
   -- Added MORE_PROFITABLE_TRADE_GOODS option to gamedefs.   If this is
      enabled the selling price for a trade good in a city ranges from 60-114
      and the price a city will pay ranges from 150-210.   If it is not
      enabled, the price ranges from 60-90 for selling and from 90-120 for
      buying.  This option is not on by default.
   -- Added quite a few options to help Georg Gottschalk with Ceran
   -- Added more ceran things to support Georg
   -- Fixed a bug whereby a unit which studied a mage skill but failed to
      study due to insufficient funds was still marked (and counted) as a
      mage.
   -- Fixed a bug that allowed units apprentices to become mages and vice
      versa without needing to FORGET first.
   -- Guarding units see who they forbid entry too.
   -- A unit forbidden entry (or the guarding unit) will see the faction of
      the unit that forbid them (or that they forbid) if they have sufficient
      observation of if the unit is revealing faction.
   -- Added BATTLE_FACTION_INFO option in gamedefs.   If this is true, then
      units involved in a battle will display their faction information IF
      *ANY* unit on the opposite side has sufficent OBSE to see it.   The
      reason this is an option (unlike the guarding units one) is that the
      same battle report is sent to non-involved observers of the battle.
      Due to the way the battle information is stored, it is not possible to
      customize this info per-faction seeing.
   -- Fixed a bug where a failed build incremented the building sequence
      number leading to a method whereby a region could be made deliberately
      unusable for building.
   -- Increased the range on the days of skill so that it shouldn't wrap
      to negatives.  Overflow sucks.
   -- Changed the message when no spoils are gained in a battle to
      'Spoils: none.' to alleviate problems with clients that didn't bother
      to figure out that the message used to be 'No spoils'.  Besides, a
      consistant format is good.
   -- Implemented WITHDRAW order, making unlimited markets unnecessary.
      This order is not enabled by default (enable via ALLOW_WITHDRAW in
      gamedefs.h).   If this option is enabled, the world building code will
      not build unlimited markets in the starting city, but will build regular
      markets instead (it has no effect on starting city markets after world
      generation).
   -- Fixed bug in production of BAGS that was giving all bag producers a +2
      skill level bonus.
   -- Spinning wheels now correctly help bag production.
   -- Implemented NOSPOILS flag
   -- Added some items that Tom Alsen (Tzarg) had added to a custom game.
      Some of these items have been slightly modified.
   -- Modified production code to allow an item to be built out of two items.
      When an item has two inputs, it takes man-months equal to the sum of
      the number of input units.  (For instance, if a battle axe takes 1
      unit of wood and 1 unit of iron to manufacture, then it takes 2
      man-months to produce each one)
   -- Cleaned up the city/town/village renaming code a bit (Thanks to Tom
      Alsen).  Also added a CITY_RENAME_COST, which if not zero is used as
      a multiply against the city level (1 == village, 2==town, 3==city)
      as a cost for renaming the city.
   -- Added more room for monster lairs (each terrain can now host up to
      1 of 6 instead of 1 of 4 different types of lairs).
   -- NEW RULE: A unit cannot steal from or assassinate a unit which it
      it unable to see.  A unit may not GIVE items to a unit it cannot see
      unless that unit's faction sees the giver as friendly.
   -- Added room for one additional coastal and one additional non-coastal
      race in each of the terrain type definitions.
   -- Fixed bug with a reversed sign in road building.
   -- Patch from Tom Alsen (Tzarg) to catch if unit sequence numbers got
      foobar'd and to at least attempt to repair it.   Side effect of this
      is that any orders for the repaired unit get lost, but that is
      unavoidable.  It also warns the GM so that he can look into it and
      hopefully fix it.
