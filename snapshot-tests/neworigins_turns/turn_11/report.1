gate lore [GATE] 1: Gate Lore is the art of detecting and using

  number and the Gate's location. A mage with skill 1 in Gate Lore can
  see a Gate if one exists in the same region as the mage. This
  detection is automatic; the Gate will appear in the region report. A
  mage with skill 1 in Gate Lore may also jump through a Gate into
  another region on the same level containing a gate, selected at
  random. To use Gate Lore in this manner, use the syntax CAST
  Gate_Lore RANDOM UNITS <unit> ... UNITS is followed by a list of
  units to follow the mage through the Gate (the mage always jumps
  through the Gate). At level 1, the mage may carry 15 weight units
  through the Gate (including the weight of the mage). This skill
  requires pattern [PATT] 1 and spirit [SPIR] 1 to begin to study.
  This skill costs 100 silver per month of study.

gate lore [GATE] 2: A mage with Gate Lore skill 2 can detect Gates in
  adjacent regions. The mage should use the syntax CAST Gate_Lore
  DETECT in order to detect these nearby Gates. Also at level 2 Gate
  Lore, the mage may perform a random gate jump without being
  restricted to the same level; use CAST Gate_Lore RANDOM LEVEL UNITS
  <unit> ... to use this option; when calculating weight for multi
  level jump, skill level is reduced by 1. The mage may also now carry
  500 weight units through a Gate when doing a random jump. A mage
  with Gate Lore skill 2 and higher can step through a Gate into
  another region containing a specific Gate. To use this spell, use
  the syntax CAST Gate_Lore GATE <number> UNITS <unit> ... <number>
  specifies the Gate that the mage will jump to. UNITS is followed by
  a list of units to follow the mage through the gate (the mage always
  jumps through the gate). At level 2, the mage may carry 15 weight
  units through the specific Gate (including the mage).

farsight [FARS] 1: A mage with this skill may obtain region reports on
  distant regions. The report will be as if the mage was in the
  distant region himself. The target region must be within 4 times the
  caster's skill level squared regions of the caster. Coordinates of
  locations not on the surface are scaled to the surface coordinates
  for this calculation. Attempting to view across different levels
  increases the distance by 4 per level difference. To use this skill,
  CAST Farsight REGION <x> <y> <z> where <x>, <y>, and <z> are the
  coordinates of the region that you wish to view. If you omit the <z>
  coordinate, the <z> coordinate of the caster's current region will
  be used. The <z> coordinate for the surface is '1' and the
  <z>-coordinate for the underworld is '2'. Note that Farsight cannot
  be used either into or out of the Nexus. Any other skills which the
  mage has which give region information will be used when farsight is
  used. This skill requires pattern [PATT] 1 and spirit [SPIR] 1 to
  begin to study. This skill costs 100 silver per month of study.
