    <h3>Atlantis New Origins Game #1 Storyline</h3>
    <p>
    You are refugees from different worlds. Your home was destroyed by The
    Devourer, Great Enemy 
    but you found a way to open Multidimensional Portal and escape.
    </p>
    <p>
    New world lays ahead, young and unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
    You found yourself in a weird place called Nexus, between your world and
    new one, 
    surrounded by other refugees. Six Gates stand open before you, choose one
    or push your 
    luck and use magic to teleport somewhere randomly.
    </p>
    <p>
    With your powers you can perhaps find followers and build a better place
    to live. But...
    </p>
    <p>
    What if The Devourer, Great Enemy will find this world? Will you be able
    to stop it?
    </p>
    <p>
    Ancient Scroll you found not only helped you to open Multidimensional
    Portal 
    but also was saying something about 7 Artifacts of Power. 
    Leader who will collect all of them will become an Avatar of Maker 
    and have a God-like powers.
    </p>
    <p>
    This instance of Atlantis is a semi-open-ended computer moderated
    fantasy game for any number of players. Players may attempt to carve
    out huge empires, become master magicians, intrepid explorers, rich
    traders or any other career that comes to mind.
    Each player can set their own objectives, and new players can join at
    any time.

    <h2>
      Playing Atlantis
    </h2>
    <p>
      Atlantis (as you undoubtedly already know) is a play by email game. 
      When you sign up for Atlantis, you will be sent a turn report (via
      email).  Your report completely details your position in the game. 
      After going over this report, and possibly communicating with other
      players in the game, you determine your course of action, and create a
      file of "orders", which you then send back to the Atlantis server. Then,
      at a regular interval (often one week), Atlantis collects all the
      orders, runs another turn (covering one month in game time), and sends
      all the players another report.

    <h3>
      Factions:
    </h3>
    <p>
      A player's position is called a "faction".  Each faction has a name and
      a number (the number is assigned by the computer, and used for entering
      orders). Each player is allowed to play one and ONLY one faction at any
      given time. Each faction is composed of a number of "units", each unit
      being a group of one or more people loyal to the faction.  You start the
      game with a single unit consisting of one character, plus a sum of
      money.  More people can be hired during the course of the game, and
      formed into more units.  (In these rules, the word "character" generally
      refers either to a unit consisting of only one person, or to a person
      within a larger unit.)
    </p>
    <p>
      A faction is considered destroyed, and the player knocked out of the
      game, if ever all its people are killed or disbanded (i.e. the faction
      has no units left).  The program does not consider your starting
      character to be special; if your starting character gets killed, you
      will probably have been thinking of that character as the leader of your
      faction, so some other character can be regarded as having taken the
      dead leader's place (assuming of course that you have at least one
      surviving unit!).  As far as the computer is concerned, as long as any
      unit of the faction survives, the faction is not wiped out.  (If your
      faction is wiped out, you can rejoin the game with a new starting
      character.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Each faction has a type; this is decided by the player, and determines
      what the faction may do.  The faction has 5 Faction Points, which may be
      spent on any of the 3 Faction Areas, War, Trade, and Magic.  The faction
      type may be changed at the beginning of each turn, so a faction can
      change and adapt to the conditions around it.  Faction Points spent on
      War determine the number of regions in which factions can obtain income
      by taxing or pillaging. Faction Points spent on Trade determine the
      number of regions in which a faction may conduct trade activity. Trade
      activity includes producing goods, building ships and buildings, and
      buying trade items. Faction Points spent on Magic determine the number
      of mages and apprentices the faction may have (more information on all
      of the faction activities is in further sections of the rules). Here is
      a chart detailing the limits on factions by Faction Points:

    <p>
      For example, a well rounded faction might spend 2 points on War, 1 point
      on Trade, and 2 points on Magic.  This faction's type would appear as
      "War 2 Trade 1 Magic 2", and would be able to tax 30 regions, perform
      trade in 15 regions, and have 3 mages as well as 5 apprentices.
    </p>
    <p>
      As another example, a specialized faction might spend all 5 points on
      War. This faction's type would appear as "War 5", and it would be able
      to tax 100 regions, but could not perform trade in any regions, could
      only possess 1 mage, and could only possess 1 apprentice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that it is possible to have a faction type with less than 5 points
      spent. In fact, a starting faction has one point spent on each of War,
      Trade, and Magic, leaving 2 points unspent.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a faction starts the game, it is given a one-man unit and 10000
      silver in unclaimed money.  Unclaimed money is cash that your whole
      faction has access to, but cannot be taken away in battle (silver in a
      unit's possessions can be taken in battle).  This allows a faction to
      get started without presenting an enticing target for other factions.
      Units in your faction may use the <a href="#claim">CLAIM</a> order to
      take this silver, and use it to buy goods or recruit men, or use the <a
      href="#withdraw">WITHDRAW</a> order to withdraw goods directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      An example faction is shown below, consisting of a starting character,
      Merlin the Magician, who has formed two more units, Merlin's Guards and
      Merlin's Workers. Each unit is assigned a unit number by the computer
      (completely independent of the faction number); this is used for
      entering orders. Here, the player has chosen to give his faction the
      same name ("Merlin the Magician") as his starting character.
      Alternatively, you can call your faction something like "The Great
      Northern Mining Company" or whatever.

    <h3>
      Units:
    </h3>
    <p>
      A unit is a grouping together of people, all loyal to the same faction.
      The people in a unit share skills and possessions, and execute the same
      orders each month. The reason for having units of many people, rather
      than keeping track of individuals, is to simplify the game play.  The
      computer does not keep track of individual names, possessions, or skills
      for people in the same unit, and all the people in a particular unit
      must be in the same place at all times.  If you want to send people in
      the same unit to different places, you must split up the unit.  Apart
      from this, there is little difference between having one unit of 50
      people, or 50 units of one person each, except that the former is very
      much easier to handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are different races that make up the population of Atlantis. (See
      the section on skills for a list of these.) In addition, there are
      "leaders", who are presumed to be of one of the other races, but are all
      the same in game terms. Leaders and normal people may not be mixed in
      the same unit. However, leaders are more expensive to recruit and
      maintain (more information is in the section on skills). A unit is
      treated as the least common denominator of the people within it, so a
      unit made up of two races with different strengths and weaknesses will
      have all the weaknesses, and none of the strengths of either race.
    </p>
    <a name="playing_turns"></a>
    <h3>
      Turns:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Each turn, the Atlantis server takes the orders file that you mailed to
      it, and assigns the orders to the respective units. All units in your
      faction are completely loyal to you, and will execute the orders to the
      best of their ability. If the unit does something unintended, it is
      generally because of incorrect orders; a unit will not purposefully
      betray you.
    </p>
    <p>
      A turn is equal to one game month.  A unit can do many actions at the
      start of the month, that only take a matter of hours, such as buying and
      selling commodities, or fighting an opposing faction.  Each unit can
      also do exactly one action that takes up the entire month, such as
      harvesting resources or moving from one region to another.  The orders
      which take an entire month are <a href="#advance">ADVANCE</a>, <a
      href="#build">BUILD</a>, <a href="#entertain">ENTERTAIN</a>, <a
      href="#move">MOVE</a>, <a href="#pillage">PILLAGE</a>, <a

    <h2>
      The World
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Atlantis world is divided for game purposes into hexagonal regions. 
      Each region has a name, and one of the following terrain types:  Ocean,
      Plain, Forest, Mountain, Swamp, Jungle, Desert, or Tundra (there may be
      other types of terrain to be discovered as the game progresses). Regions
      can contain units belonging to players; they can also contain structures
      such as buildings and fleets. Two units in the same region can normally
      interact, unless one of them is concealed in some way.  Two units in
      different regions cannot normally interact.  NOTE: Combat is an
      exception to this.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Regions:

    <p>
      Here is a sample region, as it might appear on your turn report:
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>

    </pre>
    <p>
      This report gives all of the available information on this region.  The
      region type is plain, the name of the surrounding area is Turia, and the
      coordinates of this region are (172,110).  The population of this region
      is 500 nomads, and there is $2500 of taxable income currently in this
      region.  Then, under the dashed line, are various details about items
      for sale, wages, etc.  Finally, there is a list of all visible units. 
      Units that belong to your faction will be so denoted by a '*', whereas
      other faction's units are preceded by a '-'.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since Atlantis is made up of hexagonal regions, the coordinate system is
      not always exactly intuitive.  Here is the layout of Atlantis regions:
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <pre>
   ____        ____
  /    \      /    \

    </pre>
    <p>
      Note that the are "holes" in the coordinate system; there is no region
      (1,2), for instance.  This is due to the hexagonal system of regions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most regions are similar to the region shown above, but the are certain
      exceptions.  Oceans, not surprisingly, have no population. Some regions
      will contain villages, towns, and cities. More information on these is
      available in the section on the economy.
    </p>
    <a name="world_structures"></a>
    <h3>
      Structures:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Regions may also contain structures, such as buildings or fleets. These
      will appear directly below the list of units.  Here is a sample
      structure:
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <pre>
+ Temple of Agrik [3] : Tower.
  - High Priest Chafin (9), leader [LEAD], sword [SWOR]
  - Rowing Doom (188), 10 nomads [NOMA], 10 swords [SWOR].
    </pre>
    <p>
      The structure lists the name, the number, and what type of structure it
      is (more information of the types of structures can be found in the
      section on the economy). Following this is a list of units inside the
      structure. Units within a structure are always visible, even if they
      would otherwise not be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Units inside structures are still considered to be in the region, and
      other units can interact with them; however, they may gain benefits,
      such as defensive bonuses in combat from being inside a building.  The
      first unit to enter an object is considered to be the owner; only this
      unit can do things such as renaming the object, or permitting other
      units to enter. The owner of an object can be identified on the turn
      report, as it is the first unit listed under the object.  Only units
      with men in them can be structure owners, so newly created units cannot
      own a structure until they contain men.

    <a name="world_nexus"></a>
    <h3>
      Atlantis Nexus:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Note: the following section contains some details that you may wish to
      skip over until you have had a chance to read the rest of the rules, and
      understand the mechanics of Atlantis.  However, be sure to read this
      section before playing, as it will affect your early plans in Atlantis.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a faction first starts in Atlantis, it begins with one unit, in a
      special region called the Atlantis Nexus. This region exists outside of
      the normal world of Atlantis, and as such has no products or
      marketplaces; it merely serves as the magical entry into Atlantis.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Nexus contains portals that provide one-way transportation to
      various terrain types.  A unit that enters one of these portals (by
      entering the portal and moving IN) will be transported to a region of
      the matching terrain type.  The region chosen is somewhat random, but
      will prefer to place players in towns where no other players are
      present.  Once a unit has passed through a portal, there is no way to
      return to the Nexus. It is also possible to use Gate Lore to get out of
      the Nexus (but not to return).
    </p>
    <a name="movement"></a>
    <div class="rule">
      
    </div>
    <h2>
      Movement
    </h2>
    <p>
      There are two main methods of movement in Atlantis.  The first is done
      using the <a href="#move">MOVE</a> order (or the <a
      href="#advance">ADVANCE</a> order), and moves units individually from
      one region to another. The other method is done using the <a
      href="#sail">SAIL</a> order, which can sail a fleet, including all of
      its occupants from one region to another. Certain powerful mages may
      also teleport themselves, or even other units, but the knowledge of the
      workings of this magic is carefully guarded.
    </p>
    <a name="movement_normal"></a>
    <h3>
      Normal Movement:
    </h3>
    <p>
      In one month, a unit can issue a single <a href="#move">MOVE</a> order,
      using one or more of its movement points. There are three modes of
      travel: walking, riding and flying. Walking units have two movement
      points, riding units have four, and flying units have six. A unit will
      automatically use the fastest mode of travel it has available. The <a
      href="#advance">ADVANCE</a> order is the same as <a
      href="#move">MOVE</a>, except that it implies attacks on units which try
      to forbid access; see the section on combat for details.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flying units are not initially available to starting players. A unit can
      ride provided that the carrying capacity of its horses is at least as
      great as the weight of its people and all other items.  A unit can walk
      provided that the carrying capacity of its people, horses, and wagons is
      at least as great as the weight of all its other items, and provided
      that it has at least as many horses as wagons (otherwise the excess
      wagons count as weight, not capacity). Otherwise the unit cannot issue a
      <a href="#move">MOVE</a> order. Most people weigh 10 units and have a
      capacity of 5 units; data for items is as follows:

      A unit which can fly is capable of travelling over water, but if the
      unit ends its turn over a water hex then it will drown..
    </p>
    <p>
      Since regions are hexagonal, each region has six neighbouring regions to
      the north, northeast, southeast, south, southwest and northwest.  Moving
      from one region to another normally takes one movement point, except
      that the following terrain types take two movement points for riding or
      walking units to enter: Forest, Mountain, Swamp, Jungle, and Tundra.
      Units may not move through ocean regions without using the <a
      href="#sail">SAIL</a> order unless they are capable of flight, and even
      then, flying units must end their movement on land or else drown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Units may also enter or exit structures while moving.  Moving into or
      out of a structure does not use any movement points at all.  Note that a
      unit can also use the <a href="#enter">ENTER</a> and <a
      href="#leave">LEAVE</a> orders to move in and out of structures, without
      issuing a <a href="#move">MOVE</a> order. The unit can also use the <a
      href="#move">MOVE</a> order to enter or leave a structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, certain structures contain interior passages to other regions. 
      The <a href="#move">MOVE</a> IN order can be used to go through these
      passages; the movement point cost is equal to the normal cost to enter
      the destination region.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example: One man with a horse, sword, and chain mail wants to move
      north, then northeast.  The capacity of the horse is 20 and the weight
      of the man and other items is 12, so he can ride and has four movement
      points. He issues the order MOVE NORTH NORTHEAST. First he moves north,
      into a plain region.  This uses one movement point. Then he moves
      northeast, into a forest region. This uses two movement points, so the
      movement is completed with one to spare.
    </p>
    <a name="movement_sailing"></a>
    <h3>
      Sailing:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Movement by sea is in some ways similar. It does not use the <a
      href="#move">MOVE</a> order however.  Instead, the owner of a fleet must
      issue the <a href="#sail">SAIL</a> order, and other units wishing to
      help sail the fleet must also issue the <a href="#sail">SAIL</a> order.
      The fleet will then, if possible, make the indicated movement, carrying
      all units on the fleet with it.  Units on board the fleet, but not
      aiding in the sailing of the fleet, may execute other orders while the
      fleet is sailing.  A unit which does not wish to travel with the fleet
      should leave the fleet in a coastal region, before the <a
      href="#sail">SAIL</a> order is processed.  (A coastal region is defined
      as a non-ocean region with at least one adjacent ocean region.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that a unit on board a fleet while it is sailing may not <a
      href="#move">MOVE</a> later in the turn, even if he doesn't issue the <a
      href="#sail">SAIL</a> order; sailing is considered to take the whole
      month. Also, units may not remain on guard while on board a sailing
      fleet; they will have to reissue the <a href="#guard">GUARD</a> 1 order
      to guard a region after sailing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most ships get four movement points per turn. A fleet can move from an
      ocean region to another ocean region, or from a coastal region to an
      ocean region, or from an ocean region to a coastal region. Ships may not
      sail through single hex land masses and must leave via the same side
      they entered or a side adjacent to that one. Ships can only be
      constructed in coastal regions. For a fleet to enter any region only
      costs one movement point; the cost of two movement points for entering,
      say, a forest coastal region, does not apply.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fleet can only move if the total weight of everything aboard does not
      exceed the fleet's capacity (the rules do not prevent an overloaded
      fleet from staying afloat, only from moving).  Also, there must be
      enough sailors aboard (using the <a href="#sail">SAIL</a> order), to
      sail the fleet, or it will not go anywhere.  Note that the sailing skill
      increases the usefulness of a unit proportionally; thus, a 1 man unit
      with level 5 sailing skill can sail a longboat alone.  (See the section
      on skills for further details on skills.)  The capacities (and costs in
      labor units) of the various basic ship types are as follows:

      Order of Movement:

      This section is probably unimportant to beginning players, but it can be
      helpful for more experienced players.
    </p>
    <p>
      Movement in Atlantis is processed one hex of movement at a time, region
      by region. Atlantis cycles through all of the regions; for each region,
      it finds any units that are due to move, and moves them (if they can
      move) one hex (and only one hex). After processing all the regions, it
      conducts any battles that result from these movements. After it has gone
      through all of the regions, units will have moved at most one hex, so it
      goes back and does the whole process again. This is repeated until all
      units have had the opportunity to move their allowed distance. Units'
      movement is spread out over these phases proportionally to their speed,
      so a unit riding at speed 4 would move twice as often as one walking at
      speed 2. If the unit requires more than one move to enter a particular
      region, then it will move once it has accumulated enough movement points
      to do so. Note that these movement points can be carried over from one
      month to another if a MOVE (or ADVANCE) command did not complete in the
      month - for example, a unit on foot trying to move into a mountain
      region in winter would not have enough movement points to enter in one
      turn, but if it continues the same move on the next turn, it would use
      the accumulated points from the last month and manage to enter the
      mountains at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sailing is handled the same way, with one minor difference: where units
      using MOVE or ADVANCE will be prevented from entering a GUARDed region
      (where the guards are unfriendly or worse to the moving unit), fleets
      will instead enter the region and then be stopped by the guards. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The following table shows when exactly units will move, given their base
      movement speed.  The "x"s mark the phases in which a unit of that speed
      will move. If you wish to make units of different speeds move together
      (for example, to coordinate an attack), you may need to tell the faster
      units to PAUSE in their movement.  See the <a href="#move">MOVE</a>
      order for details.

    <h2>
      Skills
    </h2>
    <p>
      The most important thing distinguishing one character from another in
      Atlantis is skills.  The following skills are available: mining,
      lumberjack, quarrying, hunting, fishing, herb lore, horse training,
      weaponsmith, armorer, carpenter, building, shipbuilding, entertainment,
      tactics, combat, riding, crossbow, longbow, stealth, observation,
      healing, sailing, farming, ranching, camel training, and gemcutting.
      When a unit possesses a skill, he also has a skill level to go with it. 
      Generally, the effectiveness of a skill is directly proportional to the
      skill level involved, so a unit with level 2 in a skill is twice as good
      as a unit with level 1 in the same skill.

    <a name="skills_limitations"></a>
    <h3>
      Limitations:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Skills may be learned up to a maximum level depending on the race of the
      studying unit (remembering that for units containing more than one race,
      the maximum is determined by the least common denominator).  Every race
      has a normal maximum skill level, and  a list of skills that they
      specialize in, and can learn up to higher level. Leaders, being more
      powerful, can learn skills to even higher levels. Here is a list of the
      races (including leaders) and the information on normal skill levels and
      specialized skills.

    <p>
      If units are merged together, their skills are averaged out. No rounding
      off is done; rather, the computer keeps track for each unit of how many
      total months of training that unit has in each skill. When units are
      split up, these months are divided as evenly as possible among the
      people in the unit; but no months are ever lost.
    </p>
    <a name="skills_studying"></a>
    <h3>
      Studying:
    </h3>
    <p>
      For a unit to gain level 1 of a skill, they must gain one months worth
      of training in that skill by issuing the <a href="#study">STUDY</a>
      order. To raise this skill level to 2, the unit must add an additional
      two months worth of training.  Then, to raise this to skill level 3
      requires another three months worth of training, and so forth. A month
      of training is gained when a unit uses the <a href="#study">STUDY</a>
      order.  Note that study months do not need to be consecutive; for a unit
      to go from level 1 to level 2, he can study for a month, do something
      else for a month, and then go back and complete the rest of his studies.
       A unit can also increase its level of training by using a skill.  This
      progress is much slower than studying.  Only one skill can be improved
      through practice in any month; if multiple skills are used, only the
      first will be improved.  A skill will only improve with practice if the
      unit has first studied the rudiments of the skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most skills cost $10 per person per month to study (in addition to
      normal maintenance costs).  The exceptions are Stealth and Observation
      (both of which cost $50), Magic skills (which cost $100), and Tactics
      (which costs $200).
    </p>
    <a name="skills_teaching"></a>
    <h3>
      Teaching:
    </h3>
    <p>
      A unit with a teacher can learn up to twice as fast as normal. The <a
      href="#teach">TEACH</a> order is used to spend the month teaching one or
      more other units (your own or another factions).  The unit doing the
      teaching must have a skill level greater than the unit doing the
      studying.  (Note: for all skill uses, it is skill level, not number of
      months of training, that counts. Thus, a unit with 1 month of training
      is effectively the same as a unit with 2 months of training, since both
      have a skill level of 1.)  The units being taught simply issue the <a
      href="#study">STUDY</a> order normally (also, his faction must be
      declared Friendly by the teaching faction).  Each person can only teach
      up to 10 students in a month; additional students dilute the training. 
      Thus, if 1 teacher teaches 20 men, each man being taught will gain 1 1/2
      months of training, not 2 months.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that it is quite possible for a single unit to teach two or more
      other units different skills in the same month, provided that the
      teacher has a higher skill level than each student in the skill that
      that student is studying, and that there are no more than 10 students
      per teacher.

    <h3>
      Skill Reports:
    </h3>
    <p>
      When a faction learns a new skill level for this first time, it will be
      given a report on special abilities that a unit with this skill level
      has. This report can be shown again at any time (once a faction knows
      the skill), using the <a href="#show">SHOW</a> order. For example, when
      a faction learned the skill Shoemaking level 3 for the first time, it
      might receive the following (obviously farcical) report:
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <pre>
Shoemaking [SHOE] 3: A unit with this skill may PRODUCE Sooper Dooper
  Air Max Winged Sandals.

    <h2>
      The Economy
    </h2>
    <p>
      The unit of currency in Atlantis is the silver piece. Silver is a normal
      item, with zero weight, appearing in your unit's reports. Silver is used
      for such things as buying items, and unit's maintenance.
    </p>
    <a name="economy_maintenance"></a>
    <h3>
      Maintenance Costs:
    </h3>
    <p>
      IMPORTANT:  Each and every character in Atlantis requires a maintenance
      fee each month. Anyone who ends the month without this maintenance cost
      has a 33 percent chance of starving to death. It is up to you to make
      sure that your people have enough money available. Money will be shared
      automatically between your units in the same region, if one is starving
      and another has more than enough; but this will not happen between units
      in different regions (this sharing of money applies only for maintenance
      costs, and does not occur for other purposes). If you have silver in
      your unclaimed fund, then that silver will be automatically claimed by
      units that would otherwise starve. Lastly, if a faction is allied to
      yours, their units will provide surplus cash to your units for
      maintenance, as a last resort.
    </p>
    <p>
      This fee is generally 10 silver for a normal character, and 50 silver
      for a leader. Units may substitute one unit of , grain, livestock or
      fish for each 30 silver of maintenance owed. A unit may use the <a
      href="#consume">CONSUME</a> order to specify that it wishes to use food
      items in preference to silver.  Note that these items are worth more
      when sold in towns, so selling them and using the money is more
      economical than using them for maintenance.

    <h3>
      Recruiting:
    </h3>
    <p>
      People may be recruited in a region.  The total amount of recruits
      available per month in a region, and the amount that must be paid per
      person recruited, are shown in the region description. The <a
      href="#buy">BUY</a> order is used to recruit new people. New recruits
      will not have any skills or items.  Note that the process of recruiting
      a new unit is somewhat counter-intuitive; it is necessary to <a
      href="#form">FORM</a> an empty unit, <a href="#give">GIVE</a> the empty
      unit some money, and have it <a href="#buy">BUY</a> people; see the
      description of the <a href="#form">FORM</a> order for further details.

      Items:

    <p>
      A unit may have a number of possessions, referred to as "items".  Some
      details were given above in the section on Movement, but many things
      were left out. Here is a table giving some information about common
      items in Atlantis:

    <p>
      All items except silver and trade goods are produced with the <a
      href="#produce">PRODUCE</a> order. Producing items will always produce
      as many items as during a month up to the limit of the supplies carried
      by the producing unit. The required skills and raw materials required to
      produce one output item are in the table above.
    </p>
    <p>
      If an item requires raw materials, then the specified amount of each
      material is consumed for each item produced. The higher the skill of the
      unit, the more productive each man-month of work will be.  Thus, five
      men at skill level one are exactly equivalent to one guy at skill level
      5 in terms of base output. Items which require multiple man-months to
      produce will take still benefit from higher skill level units, just not
      as quickly.  For example, if a unit of six level one men wanted to
      produce something which required three man-months per item, that unit
      could produce two of them in one month.  If their skill level was raised
      to two, then they could produce four of them in a month. At level three,
      they could then produce 6 per month.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some items may allow each man to produce multiple output items per raw
      material or have other differences from these basic rules.  Those items
      will explain their differences in the description of the item.
    </p>
    <p>
       Only Trade factions can issue <a href="#produce">PRODUCE</a> orders
      however, regardless of skill levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Items which increase production may increase production of advanced
      items in addition to the basic items listed.  Some of them also increase
      production of other tools.  Read the skill descriptions for details on
      which tools aid which production when not noted above.
    </p>
    <p>
      If an item does not list a raw material it may be produced directly from
      the land. Each region generally has at least one item that can be
      produced there.  Shown on the description of a region is a list of the
      items that can be produced, and the amount of each that can be produced
      per month.  This amount depends on the region type. It also varies from
      region to region of the same type. If the units in a region attempt to
      produce more of a commodity than can be produced that month, then the
      amount available is distributed among the producers

    <h3>
      Villages, Towns, and Cities:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Some regions in Atlantis contain villages, towns, and cities.  Villages
      add to the wages, population, and tax income of the region they are in.
      Also, villages will have an additional market for grain, livestock, and
      fish. As the village's demand for these goods is met, the population
      will increase. When the population reaches a certain threshold, the
      village will turn into a town.  A town will have some additional
      products that it demands, in addition to what it previously wanted. 
      Also a town will sell some new items as well. A town whose demands are
      being met will grow, and above another threshold it will become a
      full-blown city.  A city will have additional markets for common items,
      and will also have markets for less common, more expensive trade items.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trade items are bought and sold only by cities, and have no other
      practical uses.  However, the profit margins on these items are usually
      quite high. Buying of trade items in a region counts against a Trade
      faction's quota of regions in which it may undertake trade activity
      (note that buying and selling normal items does not, nor does selling of
      Trade items).
    </p>

    <h3>
      Buildings and Trade Structures:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Construction of buildings and ships goes as follows: each unit of work
      on a building requires a unit of the required resource and a man-month
      of work by a character with the appropriate skill and level; higher
      skill levels allow work to proceed faster (still using one unit of the
      required resource per unit of work done). Again, only Trade factions can
      issue <a href="#build">BUILD</a> orders. Here is a table of the various
      building types:

    <p>
      Size is the number of people that the building can shelter. Cost is both
      the number of man-months of labor and the number of units of material
      required to complete the building.  Mages is the number of mages that
      the building provides study facilities for, to enable unhindered study
      above level 2 in magical skills.  There are possibly other buildings
      which can be built that require more advanced resources, or odd skills
      to construct.   The description of a skill will include any buildings
      which it allows to be built.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are other structures that increase the maximum production of
      certain items in regions; for example, a Mine will increase the amount
      of iron that is available to be mined in a region.  To construct these
      structures requires a high skill level in the production skill related
      to the item that the structure will help produce. (Inns are an exception
      to this rule, requiring the Building skill, not the Entertainment
      skill.) This bonus in production is available to any unit in the region;
      there is no need to be inside the structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first structure built in a region will increase the maximum
      production of the related product by 25%; the amount added by each
      additional structure will be half of the the effect of the previous one.
       (Note that if you build enough of the same type of structure in a
      region, the new structures may not add _any_ to the production level).

      Note that these structures will not increase the availability of an item
      in a region which does not already have that item available. Also, Trade
      structures do not offer defensive bonuses (which is why they do not have
      a size associated with them).  As with regular buildings, the Cost is
      the number of man-months of labor and also the number of units of raw
      material required to complete the structure. You can use two different
      materials (wood or stone) to construct most trade structures. It is
      possible that there are structures not listed above which require either
      advanced resources to build or which increase the production of advanced
      resources.  The skill description for a skill will always note if new
      structures may be built based on knowing that skill.

    <h3>
      Roads:
    </h3>
    <p>
      There is a another type of structure called roads.  They do not protect
      units, nor aid in the production of resources, but do aid movement, and
      can improve the economy of a hex.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roads are directional and are only considered to reach from one hexside
      to the center of the hex.  To gain a movement bonus, there must be two
      connecting roads, one in each adjacent hex.  Only one road may be built
      in each direction. If a road in the given direction is connected, units
      move along that road at half cost to a minimum of 1 movement point.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example: If a unit is moving northwest, then hex it is in must have
      a northwest road, and the hex it is moving into must have a southeast
      road.
    </p>
    <p>
      To gain an economy bonus, a hex must have roads that connect to roads in
      at least two adjoining hexes.  The economy bonus for the connected roads
      raises the wages in the region by 1 point.

    <h3>
      Ships:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Ships are constructed similarly to buildings, with a few small
      differences. Firstly, they tend to be constructed out of wood, not
      stone. Secondly, their construction tends to depend on the Shipbuilding
      skill, not the Building skill. Thirdly, while unfinished buildings
      appear in the region, and may be entered by other units, unfinished
      ships appear only in their builder's inventory until they are complete. 
      If the builder <a href="#move">MOVE</a>s or they are in a fleet that <a
      href="#sail">SAIL</a>s while they have an unfinished ship in their
      possession, the ship will be discarded and lost. Finally, ships are
      never interacted with as objects directly, but when completed are placed
      in Fleet objects.  Fleets may contain one or more ships, and may be
      entered like other buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only factions with at least one faction point spent on trade can issue
      <a href="#build">BUILD</a> orders. Here is a table of the various ship
      types:

    <p>
      The capacity of a ship is the maximum weight that the ship may have
      aboard and still move. The cost is both the man-months of labor and the
      number of units of material required to complete the ship. The sailors
      are the number of skill levels of the Sailing skill that must be aboard
      the ship (and issuing the <a href="#sail">SAIL</a> order) in order for
      the ship to sail.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a ship is built, if its builder is already the owner of a fleet
      object, then the ship will be added to that fleet; otherwise a new fleet
      will be created to hold the ship.  A fleet has the combined capacity and
      sailor requirement of its constituent vessels, and moves at the speed of
      its slowest ship.

    <h3>
      Advanced Items:
    </h3>
    <p>
      There are also certain advanced items that highly skilled units can
      produce. These are not available to starting players, but can be
      discovered through study.  When a unit is skilled enough to produce one
      of these items, he will receive a skill report describing the production
      of this item. Production of advanced items is generally done in a manner
      similar to the normal items.
    </p>
    <a name="economy_income"></a>
    <h3>
      Income:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Units can earn money with the <a href="#work">WORK</a> order.  This
      means that the unit spends the month performing manual work for wages.
      The amount to be earned from this is usually not very high, so it is
      generally a last resort to be used if one is running out of money. The
      current wages are shown in the region description for each region. All
      units may <a href="#work">WORK</a>, regardless of skills or faction
      type.
    </p>
    <a name="economy_entertainment"></a>
    <h3>
      Entertainment:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Units with the Entertainment skill can use it to earn money.  A unit
      with Entertainment level 1 will earn 20 silver per man by issuing the <a
      href="#entertain">ENTERTAIN</a> order.  The total amount of money that
      can be earned this way is shown in the region descriptions.  Higher
      levels of Entertainment skill can earn more, so a character with
      Entertainment skill 2 can earn twice as much money as one with skill 1
      (and uses twice as much of the demand for entertainment in the region).
      Note that entertainment income is much less, per region, than the income
      available through working or taxing. All factions may have entertainers,
      regardless of faction type.
    </p>
    <a name="economy_taxingpillaging"></a>
    <h3>
      Taxing/Pillaging:
    </h3>
    <p>
      War factions may collect taxes in a region.  This is done using the <a
      href="#tax">TAX</a> order (which is a full month order). The amount of
      tax money that can be collected each month in a region is shown in the
      region description. A unit may <a href="#tax">TAX</a> if it has Combat
      skill of at least level 1, has a weapon and the appropriate skill to use
      it, has a mount and sufficient skill to ride it in combat or is a mage
      who knows a spell which damages enemies. Each taxing character can
      collect $50, though if the number of taxers would tax more than the
      available tax income, the tax income is split evenly among all taxers.
    </p>
    <p>
      War factions may also pillage a region. To do this requires the faction
      to have enough combat ready men in the region to tax half of the
      available money in the region. The total amount of money that can be
      pillaged will then be shared out between every combat ready unit that
      issues the <a href="#pillage">PILLAGE</a> order. The amount of money
      collected is equal to twice the available tax money. However, the
      economy of the region will be seriously damaged by pillaging, and will
      only slowly recover over time.  Note that <a href="#pillage">PILLAGE</a>
      comes before <a href="#tax">TAX</a>, so a unit performing <a
      href="#tax">TAX</a> will collect no money in that region that month.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible to safeguard one's tax income in regions one controls. 
      Units which have the Guard flag set (using the <a
      href="#guard">GUARD</a> order) will block <a href="#tax">TAX</a> orders
      issued by other factions in the same region, unless you have declared
      the faction in question Friendly. Units on guard will also block <a
      href="#pillage">PILLAGE</a> orders issued by other factions in the same
      region, regardless of your attitude towards the faction in question, and
      they will attempt to prevent Unfriendly units from entering the region. 
      Only units which are able to tax may be on guard.  Units on guard  are
      always visible regardless of Stealth skill, and will be marked as being
      "on guard" in the region description.

      Combat
    </h2>
    <p>
      Combat occurs when one unit attacks another.  The computer then gathers
      together all the units on the attacking side, and all the units on the
      defending side, and the two sides fight until an outcome is reached.
    </p>
    <a name="com_attitudes"></a>
    <h3>
      Attitudes:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Which side a faction's units will fight on depends on declared
      attitudes.  A faction can have one of the following attitudes towards
      another faction:  Ally, Friendly, Neutral, Unfriendly or Hostile.  Each
      faction has a general attitude, called the "Default Attitude", that it
      normally takes towards other factions; this is initially Neutral, but
      can be changed.  It is also possible to <a href="#declare">DECLARE</a>
      attitudes to specific factions, e.g. <a href="#declare">DECLARE</a> 27
      ALLY will declare the Ally attitude to faction 27.  (Note that this does
      not necessarily mean that faction 27 has decided to treat you as an
      ally.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Ally means that you will fight to defend units of that faction whenever
      they come under attack, if you have non-avoiding units in the region
      where the attack occurs.  You will also attempt to prevent any theft or
      assassination attempts against units of the faction, if you are capable
      of seeing the unit which is attempting the crime. It also has the
      implications of the Friendly attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      Friendly means that you will accept gifts from units of that faction. 
      This includes the giving of items, units of people, and the teaching of
      skills.  You will also admit units of that faction into buildings or
      fleets owned by one of your units, and you will permit units of that
      faction to collect taxes (but not pillage) in regions where you have
      units on guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfriendly means that you will not admit units of that faction into any
      region where you have units on guard.  You will not, however,
      automatically attack unfriendly units which are already present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hostile means that any of your units which do not have the Avoid Combat
      flag set (using the <a href="#avoid">AVOID</a> order) will attack any
      units of that faction wherever they find them.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a unit can see another unit, but does not have high enough
      Observation skill to determine its faction, it will treat the unit using
      the faction's default attitude, even if the unit belongs to an
      Unfriendly or Hostile faction, because it does not know the unit's
      identity.  However, if your faction has declared an attitude of Friendly
      or Ally towards that unit's faction, the unit will be treated with the
      better attitude; it is assumed that the unit will produce proof of
      identity when relevant. (See the section on stealth for more information
      on when units can see each other.)
    </p>
    <p>
      If a faction declares Unfriendly or Hostile as default attitude (the
      latter is a good way to die fast), it will block or attack all
      unidentified units, unless they belong to factions for which a Friendly
      or Ally attitude has been specifically declared. Units which cannot be
      seen at all cannot be directly blocked or attacked, of course.
    </p>
    <a name="com_attacking"></a>
    <h3>
      Attacking:
    </h3>
    <p>
      A unit can attack another by issuing an <a href="#attack">ATTACK</a>
      order. A unit that does not have Avoid Combat set will automatically
      attack any Hostile units it identifies as such. When a unit issues the
      <a href="#attack">ATTACK</a> order, or otherwise decides to attack
      another unit, it must first be able to attack the unit. There are two
      conditions for this; the first is that the attacking unit must be able
      to see the unit that it wishes to attack. More information is available
      on this in the stealth section of the rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      Secondly, the attacking unit must be able to catch the unit it wishes to
      attack.  A unit may only catch a unit if its effective Riding skill is
      greater than or equal to the target unit's effective Riding skill;
      otherwise, the target unit just rides away from the attacking unit. 
      Effective Riding is the unit's Riding skill, but with a potential
      maximum; if the unit can not ride, the effective Riding skill is 0; if
      the unit can ride, the maximum effective Riding is 3; if the unit can
      fly, the maximum effective Riding is 5. Note that the effective Riding
      also depends on whether the unit is attempting to attack or defend; for
      attack purposes, only one man in the unit needs to be able to ride or
      fly (generally, this means one of the men must possess a horse, or other
      form of transportation), whereas for defense purposes the entire unit
      needs to be able to ride or fly (usually meaning that every man in the
      unit must possess a horse or other form of speedier transportation).
      Also, note that for a unit to be able to use its defensive Riding
      ability to avoid attack, the unit cannot be in a building, fleet, or
      structure of any type.
    </p>
    <p>
      A unit which is on guard, and is Unfriendly towards a unit, will deny
      access to units using the <a href="#move">MOVE</a> order to enter its
      region. Note that to deny access to a unit, at least one unit from the
      same faction as the unit guarding the hex must satisfy the above
      requirements. A unit using <a href="#advance">ADVANCE</a> instead of <a
      href="#move">MOVE</a> to enter a region, will attack any units that
      attempt to deny it access.  If the advancing unit loses the battle, it
      will be forced to retreat to the previous region it moved through.  If
      the unit wins the battle and its army doesn't lose any men, it is
      allowed to continue to move, provided that it has enough movement
      points.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that these restrictions do not apply for sea combat, as units
      within a fleet are always visible, and Riding does not play a part in
      combat on board fleets.
    </p>
    <a name="com_muster"></a>
    <h3>
      The Muster:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Once the attack has been made, the sides are gathered.  Although the <a
      href="#attack">ATTACK</a> order takes a unit rather than a faction as
      its parameter (mainly so that unidentified units can be attacked), an
      attack is basically considered to be by an entire faction, against an
      entire faction and its allies.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the attacking side are all units of the attacking faction in the
      region where the fight is taking place, except those with Avoid Combat
      set.  A unit which has explicitly (or implicitly via <a
      href="#advance">ADVANCE</a>) issued an <a href="#attack">ATTACK</a>
      order will join the fight anyway, regardless of whether Avoid Combat is
      set.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also on the attacking side are all units of other factions that attacked
      the target faction (implicitly or explicitly) in the region where the
      fight is taking place.  In other words, if several factions attack one,
      then all their armies join together to attack at the same time (even if
      they are enemies and will later fight each other).
    </p>
    <p>
      On the defending side are all identifiable units belonging to the
      defending faction.  If a unit has Avoid Combat set and it belongs to the
      target faction, it will be uninvolved only if its faction cannot be
      identified by the attacking faction.  A unit which was explicitly
      attacked will be involved anyway, regardless of Avoid Combat. (This
      means that Avoid Combat is mostly useful for high stealth scouts.) Also,
      all non-avoiding units located in the target region belonging to
      factions allied with the defending unit will join in on the defending
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Units in adjacent regions can also become involved.  This is the
      exception to the general rule that you cannot interact with units in a
      different region.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a faction has at least one unit involved in the initial region, then
      any units in adjacent regions will join the fight, if they could reach
      the region and do not have Avoid Combat set. There are a few flags that
      units may set to affect this; a unit with the Hold flag (set using the
      <a href="#hold">HOLD</a> order) will not join battles in adjacent
      regions.  This flag applies to both attacking and defending factions.  A
      unit with the Noaid flag (set using the <a href="#noaid">NOAID</a>
      order) will receive no aid from adjacent hexes when attacked, or when it
      issues an attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Example:  A fight starts in region A, in the initial combat phase
      (before any movement has occurred).  The defender has a unit of soldiers
      in adjacent region B.  They have 2 movement points at this stage. They
      will buy horses later in the turn, so that when they execute their <a
      href="#move">MOVE</a> order they will have 4 movement points, but right
      now they have 2. Region A is forest, so the soldiers can join the fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to note that the units in nearby regions do not actually
      move to the region where the fighting happens; the computer only checks
      that they could move there.  (In game world terms, presumably they did
      move there to join the fight, and then moved back where they started.) 
      The computer checks for weight allowances and terrain types when
      determining whether a unit could reach the scene of the battle. Note
      that the use of fleets is not allowed in this virtual movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you order an attack on an ally (either with the <a
      href="#attack">ATTACK</a> order, or if your ally has declared you
      Unfriendly, by attempting to <a href="#advance">ADVANCE</a> into a
      region which he is guarding), then your commander will decide that a
      mistake has occurred somewhere, and withdraw your troops from the
      fighting altogether.  Thus, your units will not attack that faction in
      that region. Note that you will always defend an ally against attack,
      even if it means that you fight against other factions that you are
      allied with.
    </p>
    <a name="com_thebattle"></a>
    <h3>
      The Battle:
    </h3>
    <p>
      The troops having lined up, the fight begins. The computer selects the
      best tactician from each side; that unit is regarded as the leader of
      its side.  If two or more units on one side have the same Tactics skill,
      then the one with the lower unit number is regarded as the leader of
      that side.  If one side's leader has a better Tactics skill than the
      other side's, then that side gets a free round of attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In each combat round, the combatants each get to attack once, in a
      random order. (In a free round of attacks, only one side's forces get to
      attack.) Each combatant will attempt to hit a randomly selected enemy.
      If he hits, and the target has no armor, then the target is
      automatically killed.  Armor may provide extra defense against otherwise
      successful attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The basic skill used in battle is the Combat skill; this is used for
      hand to hand fighting.  If one soldier tries to hit another using most
      weapons, there is a 50% chance that the attacker will get an opportunity
      for a lethal blow.  If the attacker does get that opportunity, then
      there is a contest between his combat skill (modified by weapon attack
      bonus) and the defender's combat skill (modified by weapon defense
      bonus). Some weapons may not allow combat skill to affect defense (e.g.
      bows), and others may allow different skills to be used on defense (or
      offense).
    </p>
    <p>
      If the skills are equal, then there is a 1:1 (i.e. 50%) chance that the
      attack will succeed.  If the attacker's skill is 1 higher then there is
      a 2:1 (i.e. 66%) chance, if the attacker's skill is 2 higher then there
      is a 4:1 (i.e. 80%) chance, 3 higher means an 8:1 (i.e. 88%) chance, and
      so on. Similarly if the defender's skill is 1 higher, then there is only
      a 1:2 (i.e. 33%) chance, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a variety of weapons in the world which can increase a
      soldier's skill on attack or defense.  Better weapons will generally
      convey better bonuses, but not all weapons are as good in all
      situations.  Specifics about the bonuses conferred by specific weapons
      can be found both in these rules (for most basic weapons), and in the
      descriptions of the weapons themselves. Troops which are fighting
      hand-to-hand without specific weapons are assumed to be irregularly
      armed with makeshift weapons such as clubs, pitchforks, torches, etc. 
    </p>
    <p>
       Possession of a mount, and the appropriate skill to use that mount will
      also confer a bonus to the effective Combat skill. The amount of the
      bonus will depend on the level of the appropriate skill and the mount in
      question.  Some mounts are better than others, and may provide better
      bonus, but may also require higher levels of skill to get any bonus at
      all.  Some terrain might not allow mounts to give a combat advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain weapons may provide different attack and defense bonuses, or
      have additional attack bonuses against mounted opponents or other
      special characteristics. These bonuses will be listed in the item
      descriptions in the turn reports.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some melee weapons may be defined as Long or Short (this is relative to
      a normal weapon, e.g. the sword).  A soldier wielding a longer weapon
      than his opponent gets a +1 bonus to his attack skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ranged weapons are slightly different from melee weapons.  The target
      will generally not get any sort of combat bonus to defense against a
      ranged attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some weapons, including some ranged weapons, may only attack every other
      round, or even less frequently. When a weapon is not able to attack
      every round, this will be specified in the item description.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weapons may have one of several different attack types: Slashing,
      Piercing, Crushing, Cleaving and Armor Piercing.  Different types of
      armor may give different survival chances against a successful attack of
      different types.
    </p>
    <p>
      A soldier attacking with a ranged weapon will generally be treated as if
      they have a Combat skill of 0, even if they have an actual Combat skill.
       This is the trade off for being able to hit from the back line of
      fighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being inside a building confers a +2 bonus to defense.  This bonus is
      effective against ranged as well as melee weapons.  The number of men
      that a building can protect is equal to its size. The size of the
      various common buildings was listed in the <a
      href="#tablebuildings">Table of Buildings</a> earlier. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If there are too many units in a building to all gain protection from
      it, then those units who have been in the building longest will gain
      protection.  (Note that these units appear first on the turn report.) If
      a unit of 200 men is inside a Fort (capacity 50), then the first 50 men
      in the unit will gain the full +2 bonus, and the other 150 will gain no
      protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Units which have the Behind flag set are at the rear and cannot be
      attacked by any means until all non-Behind units have been wiped out. 
      On the other hand, neither can they attack with melee weapons, but only
      with ranged weapons or magic.  Once all front-line units have been wiped
      out, then the Behind flag no longer has any effect.
    </p>
    <a name="com_victory"></a>
    <h3>
      Victory!
    </h3>
    <p>
      Combat rounds continue until one side has accrued 50% losses (or more).
      The victorious side is then awarded one free round of attacks, after
      which the battle is over.  If both sides have more than 50% losses, the
      battle is a draw, and neither side gets a free round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Units with the Healing skill have a chance of being able to heal
      casualties of the winning side, so that they recover rather than dying. 
      Each character with this skill can attempt to heal 5 casualties per
      skill level. Each attempt however requires one unit of Herbs, which is
      thereby used up. Each attempt has a 50% chance of healing one casualty;
      only one attempt at Healing may be made per casualty. Healing occurs
      automatically, after the battle is over, by any living healers on the
      winning side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any items owned by dead combatants on the losing side have a 50% chance
      of being found and collected by the winning side. Each item which is
      recovered is picked up by one of the survivors able to carry it (see the
      <a href="#spoils">SPOILS</a> command) at random, so the winners
      generally collect loot in proportion to their number of surviving men.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are expecting to fight an enemy who is carrying so much equipment
      that you would not be able to move after picking it up, and you want to
      move to another region later that month, it may be worth issuing some
      orders to drop items (with the <a href="#give">GIVE</a> 0 order) or to
      prevent yourself picking up certain types of spoils (with the <a
      href="#spoils">SPOILS</a> order) in case you win the battle! Also, note
      that if the winning side took any losses in the battle, any units on
      this side will not be allowed to move, or attack again for the rest of
      the turn.

    <h2>
      Stealth and Observation
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Stealth skill is used to hide units, while the Observation skill is
      used to see units that would otherwise be hidden. A unit can be seen
      only if you have at least one unit in the same region, with an
      Observation skill at least as high as that unit's Stealth skill. If your
      Observation skill is equal to the unit's Stealth skill, you will see the
      unit, but not the name of the owning faction. If your Observation skill
      is higher than the unit's Stealth skill, you will also see the name of
      the faction that owns the unit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of Stealth skill, units are always visible when participating
      in combat; when guarding a region with the Guard flag; or when in a
      building or aboard a fleet. However, in order to see the faction that
      owns the unit, you will still need a higher Observation skill than the
      unit's Stealth skill.
    </p>
    <a name="stealthobs_stealing"></a>
    <h3>
      Stealing:
    </h3>
    <p>
      The <a href="#steal">STEAL</a> order is a way to steal items from other
      player factions without a battle. The order can only be issued by a
      one-man unit. The order specifies a target unit; the thief will then
      attempt to steal the specified item from the target unit.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the thief has higher Stealth than any of the target faction's units
      have Observation (i.e. the thief cannot be seen by the target faction),
      the theft will succeed. The target faction will be told what was stolen,
      but not by whom.  If the specified item is silver, then $200 or half the
      total available, whichever is less, will be stolen.  If it is any other
      item, then only one will be stolen (if available).
    </p>
    <p>
      Any unit with high enough Observation to see the thief will see the
      attempt to steal, whether the attempt is successful or not.  Allies of
      the target unit will prevent the theft, if they have high enough
      Observation to see the unit trying to steal.
    </p>
    <a name="stealthobs_assassination"></a>
    <h3>
      Assassination:
    </h3>
    <p>
      The <a href="#assassinate">ASSASSINATE</a> order is a way to kill
      another person without attacking and going through an entire battle.
      This order can only be issued by a one-man unit, and specifies a target
      unit.  If the target unit contains more than one person, then one will
      be singled out at random.
    </p>
    <p>
      Success for assassination is determined as for theft, i.e. the assassin
      will fail if any of the target faction's units can see him.  In this
      case, the assassin will flee, and the target faction will be informed
      which unit made the attempt.  As with theft, allies of the target unit
      will prevent the assassination from succeeding, if their Observation
      level is high enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the assassin has higher stealth than any of the target faction's
      units have Observation, then a one-on-one fight will take place between
      the assassin and the target character.  The assassin automatically gets
      a free round of attacks; after that, the battle is handled like a normal
      fight, with the exception that neither assassin nor victim can use any
      armor except leather armor, or cloth armor. Most armor is forbidden for
      the assassin because it would make it too hard to sneak around, and for
      the victim because he was caught by surprise with his armor off. If the
      assassin wins, the target faction is told merely that the victim was
      assassinated, but not by whom.  If the victim wins, then the target
      faction learns which unit made the attempt.  (Of course, this does not
      necessarily mean that the assassin's faction is known.)  The winner of
      the fight gets 50% of the loser's property as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="#steal">STEAL</a> and <a href="#assassinate">ASSASSINATE</a>
      are not full month orders, and do not interfere with other activities,
      but a unit can only issue one <a href="#steal">STEAL</a> order or one <a
      href="#assassinate">ASSASSINATE</a> order in a month.

    <h2>
      Magic
    </h2>
    <p>
      A character enters the world of magic in Atlantis by beginning study on
      one of the Foundation magic skills.  Only one man units, with the man
      being a leader, are permitted to study these skills. The number of these
      units (known as "magicians" or "mages") that a faction may own is
      determined by the faction's type. Any attempt to gain more, either
      through study, or by transfer from another faction, will fail.  In
      addition, mages may not <a href="#give">GIVE</a> men at all; once a unit
      becomes a mage (by studying one of the Foundations), the unit number is
      fixed. (The mage may be given to another faction using the <a
      href="#give">GIVE</a> UNIT order.)
    </p>
    <a name="magic_skills"></a>
    <h3>
      Magic Skills:
    </h3>
    <p>
      Magic skills are the same as normal skills, with a few differences.  The
      basic magic skills, called Foundations, are force, pattern, and spirit.
      To become a mage, a unit undertakes study in one of these Foundations. 
      As a unit studies the Foundations, he will be able to study deeper into
      the magical arts; the additional skills that he may study will be
      indicated on your turn report.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two major differences between Magic skills and most normal
      skills. The first is that the ability to study Magic skills sometimes
      depends on lower level Magic skills. Magic skills cannot be learnt to a
      higher level than the skills they depend upon. For example, if a Magic
      skill requires Spirit 2 to begin to study, then it can never be studied
      to a level higher than the mage's Spirit skill, so in order to increase
      that skill to level 3, his Spirit skill would first have to be increased
      to level 3. The Magic skills that a mage may study are listed on his
      turn report, so he knows which areas he may pursue. Studying higher in
      the Foundation skills, and certain other Magic skills, will make other
      skills available to the mage. Secondly, study into a magic skill above
      level 2 requires that the mage be located in some sort of building which
      can offer specific facilities for mages.  Certain types of buildings can
      offer shelter and support and a proper environment, some more so than
      others. If the mage is not in such a structure, his study rate is cut in
      half, as he does not have the proper environment and equipment for
      research.

            Foundations:
          </h3>
          <p>
            The three Foundation skills are called force, pattern, and spirit.
            Force indicates the quantity of magical energy that a mage is able
            to channel (a Force rating of 0 does not mean that the mage can
            channel no magical energy at all, but only a minimal amount).
            Pattern indicates ability to handle complex patterns, and is
            important for things like healing and nature spells.  Spirit deals
            with meta-effects that lie outside the scope of the physical
            world.

          <h3>
            Further Magic Study:
          </h3>
          <p>
            Once a mage has begun study of one or more Foundations, more
            skills that he may study will begin to show up on his report.
            These skills are the skills that give a mage his power.  As with
            normal skills, when a mage achieves a new level of a magic skill,
            he will be given a skill report, describing the new powers (if
            any) that the new skill confers.  The <a href="#show">SHOW</a>
            order may be used to show this information on future reports.
          </p>
          <a name="magic_usingmagic"></a>
          <h3>
            Using Magic:
          </h3>
          <p>
            A mage may use his magical power in three different ways,
            depending on the type of spell he wants to use.  Some spells, once
            learned, take effect automatically and are considered always to be
            in use; these spells do not require any order to take effect.
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, some spells are for use in combat. A mage may specify
            that he wishes to use a spell in combat by issuing the <a
            href="#combat">COMBAT</a> order.  A combat spell specified in this
            way will only be used if the mage finds himself taking part in a
            battle.
          </p>
          <p>
            The third type of spell use is for spells that take an entire
            month to cast.  These spells are cast by the mage issuing the <a
            href="#cast">CAST</a> order. Because <a href="#cast">CAST</a>
            takes an entire month, a mage may use only one of this type of
            spell each turn. Note, however, that a <a href="#cast">CAST</a>
            order is not a full month order; a mage may still <a
            href="#move">MOVE</a>, <a href="#study">STUDY</a>, or use any
            other month long order. The justification for this (as well as
            being for game balance) is that a spell drains a mage of his magic
            power for the month, but does not actually take the entire month
            to cast.
          </p>
          <p>
            The description that a mage receives when he first learns a spell
            specifies the manner in which the spell is used (automatic, in
            combat, or by casting).
          </p>

          <h3>
            Magic in Combat:
          </h3>
          <p>
            NOTE: This section is rather vague, and quite advanced.  You may
            want to wait until you have figured out other parts of Atlantis
            before trying to understand exactly all of the rules in this
            section.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the magic skills and spells are unspecified in these
            rules, left for the players to discover, the rules for combat
            spells' interaction are spelled out here.  There are five major
            types of attacks, and defenses: Combat, Ranged, Energy, Weather,
            and Spirit.  Every attack and defense has a type, and only the
            appropriate defense is effective against an attack.
          </p>
          <p>
            Defensive spells are cast at the beginning of each round of
            combat, and will have a type of attack they deflect, and skill
            level (Defensive spells are generally called Shields).  Every time
            an attack is launched against an army, it must first attack the
            highest level Shield of the same type as the attack, before it may
            attack a soldier directly. Note that an attack only has to attack
            the highest Shield, any other Shields of the same type are ignored
            for that attack.
          </p>
          <p>
            An attack spell (and any other type of attack) also has an attack
            type, and attack level, and a number of blows it deals. When the
            attack spell is cast, it is matched up against the most powerful
            defensive spell of the appropriate type that the other army has
            cast.  If the other army has not cast any applicable defensive
            spells, the attack goes through unmolested.  Unlike normal combat
            however, men are at a disadvantage to defending against spells.  
            Men which are in the open (not protected by a building) have an
            effective skill of -2 unless they have a shield or some other
            defensive magic.  Some monsters have bonuses to resisting some
            attacks but are more susceptible to others. The skill level of the
            attack spell and the effective skill for defense are matched
            against each other.  The formula for determining the victor
            between a defensive and offensive spell is the same as for a
            contest of soldiers; if the levels are equal, there is a 1:1
            chance of success, and so on.  If the offensive spell is
            victorious, the offensive spell deals its blows to the defending
            army, and the Shield in question is destroyed (thus, it can be
            useful to have more than one of the same type of Shield in effect,
            as the other Shield will take the place of the destroyed one). 
            Otherwise, the attack spell disperses, and the defending spell
            remains in place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some spells do not actually kill enemies, but rather have some
            negative effect on them. These spells are treated the same as
            normal spells; if there is a Shield of the same type as them, they
            must attack the Shield before attacking the army. Physical attacks
            that go through a defensive spell also must match their skill
            level against that of the defensive spell in question.  However,
            they do not destroy the defensive spell when they are successful.

            Apprentices may be created by having a unit study manipulation.
            Like Mages, only one man units, with the man being a leader, may
            become Apprentices. Apprentices may not cast spells, but may use
            items which otherwise only mages can use.

            Non-Player Units

          <p>
            There are a number of units that are not controlled by players
            that may be encountered in Atlantis.  Most information about these
            units must be discovered in the course of the game, but a few
            basics are below.

            City and Town Guardsmen:
          </h3>
          <p>
            All cities and towns begin with guardsmen in them.  These units
            will defend any units that are attacked in the city or town, and
            will also prevent theft and assassination attempts, if their
            Observation level is high enough. They are on guard, and will
            prevent other units from taxing or pillaging. The guards may be
            killed by players, although they will form again if the city is
            left unguarded.

            Wandering Monsters:

          <p>
            There are a number of monsters who wander free throughout
            Atlantis.  They will occasionally attack player units, so be
            careful when wandering through the wilderness.

            Controlled Monsters:
          </h3>
          <p>
            Through various magical methods, you may gain control of certain
            types of monsters. These monsters are just another item in a
            unit's inventory, with a few special rules. Monsters will be able
            to carry things at their speed of movement; use the <a
            href="#show">SHOW</a> ITEM order to determine the carrying
            capacity and movement speed of a monster. Monsters will also fight
            for the controlling unit in combat; their strength can only be
            determined in battle. Also, note that a monster will always fight
            from the front rank, even if the controlling unit has the behind
            flag set. Whether or not you are allowed to give a monster to
            other units depends on the type of monster; some may be given
            freely, while others must remain with the controlling unit.

          <h2>
            Orders
          </h2>
          <p>
            To enter orders for Atlantis, you should send a mail message to
            the Atlantis server, containing the following:
          </p>
          <p>
            
          </p>
          <pre>
#ATLANTIS faction-no <password>

UNIT unit-no
...orders...

UNIT unit-no
...orders...

#END
          </pre>
          <p>
            For example, if your faction number (shown at the top of your
            report) is 27, your password if "foobar", and you have two units
            numbered 5 and 17:
          </p>
          <p>
            
          </p>
          <pre>
#ATLANTIS 27 "foobar"

UNIT 5
...orders...

UNIT 17
...orders...

#END
          </pre>
          <p>
            Thus, orders for each unit are given separately, and indicated
            with the UNIT keyword.  (In the case of an order, such as the
            command to rename your faction, that is not really for any
            particular unit, it does not matter which unit issues the command;
            but some particular unit must still issue it.)
          </p>
          <p>
            IMPORTANT: You MUST use the correct #ATLANTIS line or else your
            orders will be ignored.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have a password set, you must specify it on you #atlantis
            line, or the game will reject your orders.  See the <a
            href="#password">PASSWORD</a> order for more details.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each type of order is designated by giving a keyword as the first
            non-blank item on a line.  Parameters are given after this,
            separated by spaces or tabs. Blank lines are permitted, as are
            comments; anything after a semicolon is treated as a comment
            (provided the semicolon is not in the middle of a word).
          </p>
          <p>
            The parser is not case sensitive, so all commands may be given in
            upper case, lower case or a mixture of the two.  However, when
            supplying names containing spaces, the name must be surrounded by
            double quotes, or else underscore characters must be used in place
            of spaces in the name.  (These things apply to the #ATLANTIS and
            #END lines as well as to order lines.)
          </p>
          <p>
            You may precede orders with the at sign (@), in which case they
            will appear in the Template at the bottom of your report.  This is
            useful for orders which your units repeat for several months in a
            row.

            All common items and skills have abbreviations that can be used
            when giving orders, for brevity.  Any time you see the item on

          <p>
            To specify a [unit], use the unit number.  If specifying a unit
            that will be created this turn, use the form "NEW #" if the unit
            belongs to your faction, or "FACTION # NEW #" if the unit belongs
            to a different faction.  See the <a href="#form">FORM</a> order
            for a more complete description.  [faction] means that a faction
            number is required; [object] means that an object number
            (generally the number of a building or fleet) is required. [item]
            means an item (like wood or longbow) that a unit can have in its
            possession. [flag] is an argument taken by several orders, that
            sets or unsets a flag for a unit. A [flag] value must be either 1
            (set the flag) or 0 (unset the flag).  Other parameters are
            generally numbers or names.
          </p>
          <p>
            IMPORTANT: Remember that names containing spaces (e.g., "Plate
            Armor"), must be surrounded by double quotes, or the spaces must
            be replaced with underscores "_" (e.g., Plate_Armor).
          </p>

            skill actually exists within the game.

            Attack a target unit.  If multiple ATTACK orders are given, all of
            the targets will be attacked.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example:
          </p>
          <p>
            To attack units 17, 431, and 985:

            AUTOTAX [flag]
          </h4>
          <p>
            AUTOTAX 1 causes the unit to attempt to tax every turn (without
            requiring the TAX order) until the flag is unset. AUTOTAX 0 unsets
            the flag.
          </p>

            Example:

            AVOID [flag]
          </h4>
          <p>
            AVOID 1 instructs the unit to avoid combat wherever possible. The
            unit will not enter combat unless it issues an ATTACK order, or
            the unit's faction is attacked in the unit's hex. AVOID 0 cancels
            this.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Guard and Avoid Combat flags are mutually exclusive; setting
            one automatically cancels the other.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example:
          </p>
          <p>
            Set the unit to avoid combat when possible.

            BUILD given with no parameters causes the unit to perform work on
            an unfinished ship it possesses, or on the object that it is
            currently inside.  BUILD given with an [object type] (such as
            "Tower" or "Galleon") instructs the unit to begin work on a new
            object of the type given. The final form instructs the unit to
            assist the target unit in its current building task, even if that
            task was begun this same turn. This help will be rejected if the
            unit you are trying to help does not consider you to be friendly.

            [quantity], it will attempt to buy as many as it can. If the
            demand for the item (from all units in the region) is greater than
            the number available, the available items will be split among the
            buyers in proportion to the amount each buyer attempted to buy.
            When buying people, specify the race of the people as the [item],
            or you may use PEASANT or PEASANTS to recruit whichever race is
            present in the region. If the second form is specified, the unit

            The CONSUME order instructs the unit to use food items in

            unit to use food items that are in that unit's possession before
            using silver. CONSUME FACTION tells the unit to use any food items
            that the faction owns (in the same region as the unit) before
            using silver. CONSUME tells the unit to use silver before food
            items (this is the default).

            This order allows any two units that can see each other, to trade
            items regardless of faction stances.  The orders given by the two
            units must be complementary.  If either unit involved does not
            have the items it is offering, or if the exchange orders given are
            not complementary, the exchange is aborted.  Men may not be
            exchanged.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example:
          </p>
          <p>
            Exchange 10 LBOW for 10 SWOR with unit 1310

          <h4>
            FACTION [type] [points] ...
          </h4>
          <p>
            Attempt to change your faction's type.  In the order, you can
            specify up to three faction types (WAR, TRADE, and MAGIC) and the
            number of faction points to assign to each type; if you are
            assigning points to only one or two types, you may omit the types
            that will not have any points.
          </p>
          <p>
            Changing the number of faction points assigned to MAGIC may be
            tricky. Increasing the MAGIC points will always succeed, but if
            you decrease the number of points assigned to MAGIC, you must make
            sure that you have only the number of magic-skilled leaders
            allowed by the new number of MAGIC points BEFORE you change your
            point distribution. For example, if you have 3 mages (3 points
            assigned to MAGIC), but want to use one of those points for WAR or
            TRADE (change to MAGIC 2), you must first get rid of one of your
            mages by either giving it to another faction or ordering it to <a
            href="#forget">FORGET</a> all its magic skills. If you have too
            many mages for the number of points you try to assign to MAGIC,
            the FACTION order will fail.
          </p>
          <p>
            Examples:
          </p>
          <p>
            Assign 2 faction points to WAR, 2 to TRADE, and 1 to MAGIC.

            FORM [alias]
          </h4>
          <p>
            Form a new unit.  The newly created unit will be in your faction,
            in the same region as the unit which formed it, and in the same
            structure if any.  It will start off, however, with no people or
            items; you should, in the same month, issue orders to transfer
            people into the new unit, or have it recruit members. The new unit
            will inherit its flags from the unit that forms it, such as
            avoiding, behind, revealing and sharing, with the exception of the
            guard and autotax flags.  If the new unit wants to guard or
            automatically tax then those flags will have to be explicitly set
            in its orders.
          </p>
          <p>
            The FORM order is followed by a list of orders for the newly
            created unit.  This list is terminated by the END keyword, after
            which orders for the original unit resume.
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose of the "alias" parameter is so that you can refer to
            the new unit. You will not know the new unit's number until you
            receive the next turn report.  To refer to the new unit in this
            set of orders, pick an alias number (the only restriction on this
            is that it must be at least 1, and you should not create two units
            in the same region in the same month, with the same alias
            numbers).  The new unit can then be referred to as NEW <alias> in
            place of the regular unit number.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can refer to newly created units belonging to other factions,
            if you know what alias number they are, e.g. FACTION 15 NEW 2 will
            refer to faction 15's newly created unit with alias 2.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note: If a unit moves out of the region in which it was formed (by
            the <a href="#move">MOVE</a> order, or otherwise), the alias will
            no longer work. This is to prevent conflicts with other units that
            may have the same alias in other regions.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the demand for recruits in that region that month is much
            higher than the supply, it may happen that the new unit does not
            gain all the recruits you ordered it to buy, or it may not gain
            any recruits at all.  If the new units gains at least one recruit,
            the unit will form possessing any unused silver and all the other
            items it was given.  If no recruits are gained at all, the empty
            unit will be dissolved, and the silver and any other items it was
            given will revert to the first unit you have in that region.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example:
          </p>
          <p>
            This set of orders for unit 17 would create two new units with
            alias numbers 1 and 2, name them Merlin's Guards and Merlin's
            Workers, set the description for Merlin's Workers, have both units
            recruit men, and have Merlin's Guards study combat.  Merlin's
            Workers will have the default order <a href="#work">WORK</a>, as
            all newly created units do. The unit that created these two then
            pays them enough money (using the NEW keyword to refer to them by
            alias numbers) to cover the costs of recruitment and the month's
            maintenance.

            The first form of the GIVE order gives a quantity of an item to
            another unit. The second form of the GIVE order will give all of a
            given item to another unit.  The third form will give all of an
            item except for a specific quantity to another unit.  The fourth
            form will give all items of a specific type to another unit.  The
            final form of the GIVE order gives the entire unit to the
            specified unit's faction.
          </p>
          <p>
            The classes of items which are acceptable for the fourth form of
            this order are, NORMAL, ADVANCED, TRADE, MAN or MEN, MONSTER or
            MONSTERS, MAGIC, WEAPON or WEAPONS, ARMOR, MOUNT or MOUNTS,
            BATTLE, SPECIAL, TOOL or TOOLS, FOOD, SHIP or SHIPS and ITEM or
            ITEMS (which is the combination of all of the previous
            categories).
          </p>
          <p>
            A unit may only give items, including silver, to a unit which it
            is able to see, unless the faction of the target unit has declared
            you Friendly or better.  If the target unit is not a member of
            your faction, then its faction must have declared you Friendly,
            with a couple of exceptions. First, silver may be given to any
            unit, regardless of factional affiliation. Secondly, men may not
            be given to units in other factions (you must give the entire
            unit); the reason for this is to prevent highly skilled units from
            being sabotaged with a <a href="#give">GIVE</a> order.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfinished ships are given like other items, although a unit may
            only have one unfinished ship of a given type at a time. To give
            unfinished ships, add the "UNFINISHED" keyword to the beginning of
            the [item] specifier.
          </p>
          <p>
            Completed ships which are part of a fleet may be given too; the
            owner of the fleet they are currently in must issue the <a
            href="#give">GIVE</a> order, and give the ships to the owner of
            the fleet that should receive the ships.  If the recipient is not
            the owner of a fleet, then a new fleet will be created owned by
            the recipient.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are also a few restrictions on orders given by units who
            been given to another faction. If the receiving faction is not
            allied to the giving faction, the unit may not issue the <a
            href="#advance">ADVANCE</a> order, or issue any more <a
            href="#give">GIVE</a> orders.  Both of these rules are to prevent
            unfair sabotage tactics.
          </p>
          <p>
            If 0 is specified as the unit number, then the items are
            discarded.

            GUARD 1 sets the unit issuing the order to prevent non-Friendly
            units from collecting taxes in the region, and to prevent any
            units not your own from pillaging the region.  Guarding units will
            also attempt to prevent Unfriendly units from entering the region.
             GUARD 0 cancels Guard status.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Guard and Avoid Combat flags are mutually exclusive; setting
            one automatically cancels the other.

            HOLD 1 instructs the issuing unit to never join a battle in

          <p>
            Attempt to enter the building or fleet that the specified unit is
            currently inside.  This is particularly useful if you don't know
            what the building or fleet number will be, as is the case when a
            new fleet is created.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the target unit is not inside a building or fleet, then the
            unit issuing the JOIN command will leave any building or fleet
            that they happen to be inside, to be with the target.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the NOOVERLOAD flag is specified, and the target unit ends up
            on board a fleet, then the unit issuing the JOIN command will only
            attempt to board the fleet if the fleet would be able to sail with
            the issuing units' weight loaded on board.
          </p>
          <p>
            The MERGE flag may only be used by the owner of a fleet, and will
            cause the entire fleet they command to join the fleet owned by the
            specified unit - the units on board will move to the other fleet,
            and all the ships of the fleet will be given to the target fleet.
            This command will fail if any unit in the fleet to be merged would
            be denied entry to the target fleet.
          </p>

          <p>
            Leave the object you are currently in. If a unit is capable of
            swimming or flying then this order is usable to leave a boat while
            at sea.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example:
          </p>
          <p>
            Leave the current object
          </p>

          <h4>
            MOVE [dir] ...
          </h4>
          <p>
            Attempt to move in the direction(s) specified.  If more than one
            direction is given, the unit will move multiple times, in the
            order specified by the MOVE order, until no more directions are
            given, or until one of the moves fails.  A move can fail because
            the units runs out of movement points, because the unit attempts
            to move into the ocean, or because the units attempts to enter a
            structure, and is rejected.
          </p>
          <p>
            Valid directions are:
          </p>
          <p>
            1) The compass directions North, Northwest, Southwest, South,
            Southeast, and Northeast.  These can be abbreviated N, NW, SW, S,
            SE, NE.
          </p>
          <p>
            2) A structure number.
          </p>
          <p>
            3) OUT, which will leave the structure that the unit is in.
          </p>
          <p>
            4) IN, which will move through an inner passage in the structure
            that the unit is currently in.
          </p>
          <p>
            5) PAUSE, which will instruct the unit to spend one movement point
            admiring the scenery, presumably to coordinate with slower moving
            companions.  This can be abbreviated P.
          </p>
          <p>
            Multiple MOVE orders given by one unit will chain together.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that MOVE orders can lead to combat, due to hostile units
            meeting, or due to an advancing unit being forbidden access to a
            region.  Combat occurs after an antire movement phase has been
            completed for all regions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example 1: Units 1 and 2 are in Region A, and unit 3 is in Region
            B.  Units 1 and 2 are hostile to unit 3.  Both units 1 and 2 move
            into region B, and attack unit 3.  Since combat happens after all
            movement has been done for the phase, they attack unit 3 at the
            same time, and the battle is between units 1 and 2, and unit 3.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example 2: Same as example 1, except unit 2 is in Region C,
            instead of region A.  Both units move into Region B, and attack
            unit 3.  Because combat happens after all movement has been done
            for the phase, they still attack unit 3 at the same time, and the
            battle is still between units 1 and 2, and unit 3.

            Change the name of the unit, or of your faction, or of the object
            the unit is in (of which the unit must be the owner). Names can be
            of any length, up to the line length your mailer can handle. 
            Names may not contain parentheses (square brackets can be used
            instead if necessary), or any control characters.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to rename a settlement (city, town or village), the unit
            attempting to rename it must be the owner of a large enough
            structure located in the city. It requires a tower or better to
            rename a village, a fort or better to rename a town and a castle
            or mystic fortress to rename a city. It also costs $2000 to rename
            a village, $4000 to rename a town, and $6000 to rename a city.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example:

          <p>
            Name your faction "The Merry Pranksters".

            NOAID [flag]
          </h4>
          <p>
            NOAID 1 indicates that if the unit attacks, or is attacked, it is
            not to be aided by units in other hexes. NOAID status is very
            useful for scouts or probing units, who do not wish to drag their
            nearby armies into battle if they are caught. NOAID 0 cancels
            this.
          </p>
          <p>
            If multiple units are on one side in a battle, they must all have
            the NOAID flag on, or they will receive aid from other hexes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example:
          </p>
          <p>
            Set a unit to receive no aid in battle.

            NOCROSS [flag]
          </h4>
          <p>
            NOCROSS 1 indicates that if a unit attempts to cross a body of
            water then that unit should instead not cross it, regardless of
            whether the unit otherwise could do so. Units inside a fleet are
            not affected by this flag (IE, they are able to sail within the
            fleet). This flag is useful to prevent scouts from accidentally
            drowning when exploring in games where movement over water is
            allowed. NOCROSS 0 cancels this.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example:
          </p>
          <p>
            Set a unit to not permit itself to cross water.

            The OPTION order is used to toggle various settings that affect
            your reports, and other email details. OPTION TIMES sets it so
            that your faction receives the times each week (this is the
            default); OPTION NOTIMES sets it so that your faction is not sent
            the times.
          </p>
          <p>
            OPTION SHOWATTITUDES will cause units shown in your report to have
            a character placed before their name, which indicates your
            attitude towards them.  These characters are "!" for hostile, "%"
            for unfriendly, "-" for neutral, ":" for friendly and "=" for
            allied. OPTION DONTSHOWATTITUDES turns off this additional
            decoration. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The OPTION TEMPLATE order toggles the length of the Orders
            Template that appears at the bottom of a turn report.  The OFF
            setting eliminates the Template altogether, and the SHORT, LONG
            and MAP settings control how much detail the Template contains.
            The MAP setting will produce an ascii map of the region and
            surrounding regions in addition other details.

          <p>
            The PASSWORD order is used to set your faction's password. If you
            have a password set, you must specify it on your #ATLANTIS line
            for the game to accept your orders.  This protects you orders from
            being overwritten, either by accident or intentionally by other
            players.  PASSWORD with no password given clears out your
            faction's password.
          </p>
          <p>
            IMPORTANT: The PASSWORD order does not take effect until the turn
            is actually run.  So if you set your password, and then want to
            re-submit orders, you should use the old password until the turn
            has been run.

            This command allows a mage or apprentice to prepare a battle item
            (e.g. a Staff of Fire) for use in battle. This allows the unit to
            override the usual selection of battle items, and also cancels any

            Spend the month producing the specified item.  If a number is
            given then the unit will attempt to produce exactly that number of
            items; if this is not possible in one month then the order will

            Quit the game.  On issuing this order, your faction will be
            completely and permanently destroyed. Note that you must give your

          <p>
            Note that although this order affects the faction as a whole, it
            nevertheless needs to be issued by an individual unit, and so the
            email containing the command to quit needs to include both
            #atlantis and unit lines.

            begin a brand new faction for you (you will get a separate turn
            report for the new faction). Note that you must give your password

          <h4>
            SHARE [flag]
          </h4>
          <p>
            SHARE 1 instructs the unit to share its possessions with any other
            unit of your faction that needs them.  Thus a unit with a supply
            of silver could automatically provide silver if any of your other
            units in the same region does not have enough to perform an
            action, such as <a href="#study">studying</a>, <a
            href="#buy">buying</a> or <a href="#produce">producing</a>.  SHARE
            0 returns a unit to its default selfish state.
          </p>
          <p>
            This sharing does not extend to the heat of battle, only to
            economic actions.  So a unit that is sharing will provide silver
            for buying or studying, and resources for production (for example,
            if a sharing unit has wood in its inventory, and another unit is
            producing axes but has no wood, then the sharing unit will
            automatically supply wood for that production), but will not
            provide weapons to all units if combat occurs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that in the case of sharing silver, this can leave the
            sharing unit without enough funds to pay maintenance, so sharing
            is to be used with care.  You may like to make sure that there is
            a unit with sufficient funds for maintenance in the same region,
            and which is not sharing, as those funds will be shared for
            maintenance, but not for less important purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Example:
          </p>
          <p>
            Instruct the unit to share its possessions with other units of the
            same faction.

            SPOILS
          </h4>
          <p>
            The SPOILS order determines which types of spoils the unit should
            take after a battle.  The valid values for type are 'NONE',
            'WALK', 'RIDE', 'FLY', 'SWIM', 'SAIL' or 'ALL'. The second form is
            equivalent to 'SPOILS ALL'.
          </p>
          <p>
            When this command is issued, the unit is instructed to only pick
            up combat spoils if they could use the chosen form of movement
            while carrying the spoils. Thus a unit with SPOILS FLY selected
            would pick up combat spoils until they reached their flying
            capacity.  If the spoils provide movement capacity themselves,
            this will be included in the decision of whether or not to take
            the spoils - so a unit with SPOILS RIDE would always pick up
            horses. SPOILS SAIL will use the capacity of the fleet the unit is
            in to determine whether to take spoils or not. SPOILS ALL will
            allow a unit to collect any spoils which are dropped regardless of
            weight or capacity. SPOILS NONE will instruct the unit to only
            collect weightless items, such as silver.

          </h4>
          <p>
            The TAKE order works just like the <a href="#give">GIVE</a> order,
            except that the direction of transfer is reversed, and with the
            extra condition that a unit may only TAKE from another unit in the
            same faction. Since that makes TAKE FROM [unit] UNIT pointless,
            that form of the <a href="#give">GIVE</a> order is not supported.
          </p>
          <p>
            The TAKE order is primarily intended to make automated delivery
            caravans less prone to generating errors, as they can use TAKE to
            collect the appropriate goods only when they are in the right
            place to collect, so the supplying unit doesn't need to keep
            trying to <a href="#give">GIVE</a> to a unit that is only there
            some of the time. However, it can be used anywhere you wish to
            transfer items, ships or men, just as <a href="#give">GIVE</a>
            can.

            Attempt to collect taxes from the region. Only War factions may
            collect taxes, and then only if there are no non-Friendly units on
            guard. Only combat-ready units may issue this order. Note that the
            TAX order and the <a href="#pillage">PILLAGE</a> order are
            mutually exclusive; a unit may only attempt to do one in a turn.

            TURN
          </h4>
          <p>
            The TURN order may be used to delay orders by one (or more) turns.
            By making the TURN order repeating (via '@'), orders inside the
            TURN/ENDTURN construct will repeat.  Multiple TURN orders in a row
            will execute on successive turns, and if they all repeat, they
            will form a loop of orders.  Each TURN section must be ended by an
            ENDTURN line.
          </p>
          <p>
            Examples:
          </p>
          <p>
            Study combat this month, move north next month, and then in two
            months, pillage and advance north.

            The orders in a TURN block will be inserted into the unit's orders
            template when there are no month-long orders remaining to be
            executed.  In particular, if the unit does not have enough
            movement points to cover the full distance of a MOVE or SAIL
            command, the movement commands will automatically be completed
            over multiple turns before executing the next TURN block.

            The most important sections of the turn report are the "Events
            During Turn" section which lists what happened last month, and the
            "Current Status" section which gives the description of each
            region in which you have units.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your units in the Current Status section are flagged with a "*"
            character. Units belonging to other factions are flagged with a
            "-" character. You may be informed which faction they belong to,
            if you have high enough Observation skill or they are revealing
            that information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Objects are flagged with a "+" character.  The units listed under
            an object (if any) are inside the object.  The first unit listed
            under an object is its owner.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you can see a unit, you can see any large items it is carrying.
             This means all items other than silver, herbs, and other small
            items (which are of zero size units, and are small enough to be
            easily concealed). Items carried by your own units of course will
            always be listed.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the bottom of your turn report is an Orders Template.  This
            template gives you a formatted orders form, with all of your units
            listed. You may use this to fill in your orders, or write them on
            your own. The <a href="#option">OPTION</a> order gives you the
            option of giving more or less information in this template, or
            turning it off altogether. You can precede orders with an '@' sign
            in your orders, in which case they will appear in your template on
            the next turn's report.

            Hints for New Players
          </h2>
          <p>
            Make sure to use the correct #ATLANTIS and UNIT lines in your
            orders.
          </p>
          <p>
            Always have a month's supply of spare cash in every region in
            which you have units, so that even if they are deprived of income
            for a month (due to a mistake in your orders, for example), they
            will not starve to death.  It is very frustrating to have half
            your faction wiped out because you neglected to provide enough
            money for them to live on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Be conservative with your money. Leaders especially are very hard
            to maintain, as they cannot usually earn enough by <a
            href="#work">WORK</a>ing to pay their maintenance fee. Even once
            you have recruited men, notice that it is expensive for them to <a
            href="#study">STUDY</a> (and become productive units), so be sure
            to save money to that end.
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't leave it until the last minute to send orders.  If there is
            a delay in the mailer, your orders will not arrive on time, and
            turns will NOT be rerun, nor will it be possible to change the
            data file for the benefit of players whose orders weren't there by
            the deadline.  If you are going to send your orders at the last
            minute, send a preliminary set earlier in the week so that at
            worst your faction will not be left with no orders at all.

            Atlantis was originally created and programmed by Russell Wallace.
            Russell Wallace created Atlantis 1.0, and partially designed
            Atlantis 2.0 and Atlantis 3.0.
          </p>
          <p>
            Geoff Dunbar designed and programmed Atlantis 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 up
            through version 4.0.4 and created the Atlantis Project to freely
            release and maintain the Atlantis source code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Larry Stanbery created the Atlantis 4.0.4+ derivative.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="mailto:jtraub@dragoncat.net">JT Traub</a> took over the
            source code and merged the then forking versions of 4.0.4c and
            4.0.4+ back into 4.0.5 along with modifications of his own and has
            been maintaining the code.
