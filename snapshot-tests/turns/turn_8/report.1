gate lore [GATE] 1: Gate Lore is the art of detecting and using
  magical Gates, which are spread through the world. The Gates are
  numbered in order, but spread out randomly, so there is no
  correlation between the Gate number and the Gate's location. A mage
  with skill 1 in Gate Lore can see a Gate if one exists in the same
  region as the mage. This detection is automatic; the Gate will
  appear in the region report. A mage with skill 1 in Gate Lore may
  also jump through a Gate into another region on the same level
  containing a gate, selected at random. To use Gate Lore in this
  manner, use the syntax CAST Gate_Lore RANDOM UNITS <unit> ... UNITS
  is followed by a list of units to follow the mage through the Gate
  (the mage always jumps through the Gate). At level 1, the mage may
  carry 15 weight units through the Gate (including the weight of the
  mage). This skill requires pattern [PATT] 1 and spirit [SPIR] 1 to
  begin to study. This skill costs 100 silver per month of study.

gate lore [GATE] 2: A mage with Gate Lore skill 2 can detect Gates in
  adjacent regions. The mage should use the syntax CAST Gate_Lore
  DETECT in order to detect these nearby Gates. Also at level 2 Gate
  Lore, the mage may perform a random gate jump without being
  restricted to the same level; use CAST Gate_Lore RANDOM LEVEL UNITS
  <unit> ... to use this option; when calculating weight for multi
  level jump, skill level is reduced by 1. The mage may also now carry
  500 weight units through a Gate when doing a random jump. A mage
  with Gate Lore skill 2 and higher can step through a Gate into
  another region containing a specific Gate. To use this spell, use
  the syntax CAST Gate_Lore GATE <number> UNITS <unit> ... <number>
  specifies the Gate that the mage will jump to. UNITS is followed by
  a list of units to follow the mage through the gate (the mage always
  jumps through the gate). At level 2, the mage may carry 15 weight
  units through the specific Gate (including the mage).

gate lore [GATE] 3: A mage with Gate Lore skill 3 may carry 500 weight
  units through a Gate. Also, a level 3 mage doing a random gate jump

  weight units through a Gate. Also, a level 5 mage doing a random

farsight [FARS] 1: A mage with this skill may obtain region reports on
  distant regions. The report will be as if the mage was in the
  distant region himself. The target region must be within 4 times the
  caster's skill level squared regions of the caster. Coordinates of
  locations not on the surface are scaled to the surface coordinates
  for this calculation. Attempting to view across different levels
  increases the distance by 4 per level difference. To use this skill,
  CAST Farsight REGION <x> <y> <z> where <x>, <y>, and <z> are the
  coordinates of the region that you wish to view. If you omit the <z>
  coordinate, the <z> coordinate of the caster's current region will
  be used. Note that Farsight cannot be used either into or out of the
  Nexus. Note that Farsight does not work in conjunction with other
  skills or spells; the mage can only rely on his normal facilities
  while casting Farsight. This skill requires pattern [PATT] 1 and
  spirit [SPIR] 1 to begin to study. This skill costs 100 silver per
  month of study.

teleportation [TELE] 1: A mage with this skill may teleport himself
  across great distances, even without the use of a gate. The mage may
  teleport up to 50 weight units per skill level. The target region
  must be within 2 times the caster's skill level squared regions of
  the caster. Coordinates of locations not on the surface are scaled
  to the surface coordinates for this calculation. Attempting to view
  across different levels increases the distance by 4 per level
  difference. To use this skill, CAST Teleportation REGION <x> <y> <z>
  where <x>, <y>, and <z> are the coordinates of the region that you
  wish to teleport to. If you omit the <z> coordinate, the <z>
  coordinate of the caster's current region will be used. Note that
  Teleportation cannot be used either into or out of the Nexus. This
  skill requires gate lore [GATE] 1 and farsight [FARS] 2 to begin to
  study. This skill costs 100 silver per month of study.

portal lore [PORT] 1: A mage with the Portal Lore skill may, with the
  aid of another mage, make a temporary Gate between two regions, and

  caster must be trained in Portal Lore. The caster may teleport units
  weighing up to 800 weight units times his skill level, to the target
  mage's region.  The target region must be within 2 times the
  caster's skill level squared regions of the caster. To use this
  skill, CAST Portal_Lore <target> UNITS <unit> ..., where <target> is
  the unit number of the target mage, and <unit> is a list of units to
  be teleported (the casting mage may teleport himself, if he so
  desires). This skill requires gate lore [GATE] 2 and farsight [FARS]
  1 to begin to study. This skill costs 100 silver per month of study.
