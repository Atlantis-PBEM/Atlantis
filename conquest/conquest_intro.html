  Atlantis Conquest is a closed-ended computer wargame, where players
  compete for conquest of a fantasy world. Each player begins on an
  identical small island, just off the coast of a large central island,
  with the goal of defeating all of the other players. To this end, they
  must build up their empire from a small beginning force by raising
  fortifications, making weapons training soldiers, and studying the
  arcane disciplines of magic.
