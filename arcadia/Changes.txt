Hi all,

Arcadia IV: Xanaxor (named after the mage of the same name from Arcadia III: Nylandor) is now taking registrations. Because I am computer illiterate (except when it comes to C++ and the Atlantis code) registration will have to involve filling out the form below and emailing it to me.

The rules for Arcadia IV may be found at http://home.arcor.de/oidipus/game4. Also there are a map of Xanaxor, the hero/magic skill tree, a list of changes from Atlantis 5.0  and the 'skillshows' file which lists all skill, item and object descriptions for the game.

The game will take 12 players and the main landmass is approximately 120 hexes large. The map was handmade and every attempt made to balance the starting locations for tax/trade ability. Each player will be assigned at random to begin as an elf, dwarf or human; you get to select the race that your initial unit and home village will have. 

Turns will be run twice a week, most likely on Mondays and Thursdays or Fridays. Details on how to submit orders will arrive when the first turn is run.

The client program Atlantis Little Helper (ALH) will parse all of the features present in Xanaxor, with a little modification to its configuration files. If we are lucky some kindly person from one of our pre-games will have prepared some fully functional config files which can be shared around ...

Both of the GMs running the Arcadia series will be playing in Xanaxor.

List of Changes for Arcadia IV:
---------------------------------
Changes since the testgame/Xanaxino:

Non-undead monsters no longer cause morale penalties, and no monsters are affected by morale penalties.
Tax has been moved to occur just before the other month-long orders
Unity/Bird Lore experience reduced. Wolf Lore/Trading experience increased.
Undead have an 80% chance of coming back to life following a battle in which they are killed, provided that they are controlled by a mage who survives the battle and are NOT killed by the spell Banish Undead.
Elves defence bonus removed
Produce items are now credited when send items are recieved, to avoid eg wood being produced then shared with a weaponsmith in the same turn.
Hero skills cannot be taught
---------------------------------
Changes since Arcadia III:

Table of races changed: (5 human, 5 dwarf, 5 elf, 2 other)

Humans: raiders, barbarians, eskimos, nomads, tribesmen
Elves: ancient elves, wood elves, sea elves, high elves, tribal elves
Dwarves: plains dwarves, ice dwarves, hill dwarves, under dwarves, desert dwarves
Others: mermen, orcs

Maximum skill levels (specialist / non-specialist skills) for units are:
4/2 for normal units
6/4 for leaders
8/6 for heros
6/4 for heros studying hero/magic skills

Orders added:
SHARE (sets flag 'sharing' on/off)
SEND  (sends goods to nearby regions)
COMMAND (takes command of faction)
TEMPLATE (stores a set of orders under given name (eg TEMPLATE Scout) )
TYPE (applies a set of stored orders to the given unit, eg TYPE Scout)
LABEL (adds a label to a unit that only the owner can see)
ALL (issues orders to all units with the specified label)
SPOILS: SWIM & SAIL added
DISABLE (disables/re-enables an unwanted skill, eg summon wind)

Orders removed from Arcadia III:
GIVEIF
RECRUIT

HEROES:
Mages are renamed heroes
Leaders become leaders by studying leadership ($50); heroes become heroes when a leader studies heroship ($100). Leaders / heroes retain their race characteristics.
Hero/Mage specialities are innate, depending on the unit's race (eg barbarian or wood elf).
Wandering mages no longer exist.
Energy costs of spells no longer depend on race/speciality, though experience gained still does.
Energy is gained from the five base magic skills: Patterning, Mysticism, Winkey, Summoning and Artifact Lore. Battletraining and Charisma do not produce energy; nor do spells in those trees require energy.
There is now no hard limit on how many spells a mage may cast per month, and no extra energy cost to casting multiple spells.
A mage may not cast a particular spell more than once per month.
New magic tree.
Heros can execute a study order AND another monthlong order (other than study) in one turn.
Heros may not assassinate other heroes.
Magic shields gain a +1 bonus in combat, ie an energy shield at level 1 now functions as it used to at level 2. Force shield is unchanged.
Energy recharge rate listed in reports.
Magic skills may not be taught.

ALIGNMENTS:
Factions take on one of four alignments: Human, Elven, Dwarven, or Independent, depending on the race of their commanding unit (who must be a hero).
Alignment of factions marked in reports if unit's faction is identified.
Maintenance cost of units of the same ethnicity as the faction alignment are: 10,20,100 silver for normal, leader and hero units.
Maintenance cost of units of different ethnicity as the faction alignment are: 20,40,200 silver for normal, leader and hero units.
If the commander of a faction is killed during a month, the faction alignment will be set to "chaotic" AFTER the next maintenance phase. It may be reset at the beginning of next month by appointing a new commander. If it is not, all units will have to pay the "different ethnicity" maintenance cost.
If an army comprises mixed ethnicities, each man in the army receives (on average) a combat penalty of 2(1-f) to his attack and melee defence skills. f = the fraction of the army of the SAME ethnicity as the soldier. An average penalty of 0.3 would mean a 30% chance of a -1 penalty and a 70% chance of no penalty. This effect may be halved with the hero skill "unity".
Elves do not suffer from penalties to ranged attacks (in forests/jungles)

GUARDS:
There are now four guardfactions, one of each alignment. Guardfactions are unfriendly to factions of different alignment. 
Guard regeneration halved from Arcadia III, still depends on city untaxed income (not fixed as in Atlantis 5.0).
The final number of guards which grow in a settlement now depend on the taxation available there, while the quality of the guards depends on the size (ie village, town or city) of the settlement.
Guards in cities behave as before, except that they only prevent assassinations and stealing against factions of their own alignment (ie Elven guards will not prevent assassination of units belonging to a Dwarven faction, even if the assassinated unit is made up of elves)
There are also some regional guards outside of cities who allow taxing, but only by factions of the same alignment as the guards. Regional guards never regenerate.
Guards may be skilled in combat, riding, crossbow or longbow, depending on their race and the local terrain. Guards will be equipped with items/weapons necessary for use of their skill, so riding guards will have swords and horses, while combat guards will have only swords, and crossbow guards will have crossbows


MISCELLANEOUS:
New armour table (only minor changes from Arcadia III)
Item sharing implemented for EXCHANGE, SEND, STUDY, PRODUCE, BUILD, BUY (Not for SELL).
Bridge cost reduced to 40 / skill 3.
Units transiting through a region will recieve a report on the region (not including units in the region).
Ranged attacks get +1 bonus in oceans and deserts
Populations multiplied by 20.
The formula for available taxation has changed so that available taxation income is no longer as sensitive to changes in wages, increasing taxation abilities in the "low tax" regions (jungle, tundra etc.).
Units that have some swimming capacity, but weigh more than their capacity, will discard items (from heaviest to lightest, including non-swimming men) until they can swim, instead of drowning (though if there are no mermen in the unit, this may currently result in discarding all men).
Spoils order modified so that, for example, spoils ride allows a unit to pick up items until picking up any more would prevent them riding. Also, two new spoils options (swim, sail) added.
Disabling or forgetting a hero's combat spell sets their combat spell to 'none'.
Towers, forts, etc. have different defences, ranging from a +2 bonus (tower) to a +4 bonus (magical fortress). Forts and Citadels have greater defence bonuses for non-melee attacks (+3/+4) than for melee attacks (+2/+3).
Number of trade items reduced to 12 (from 19)
Unit 'labels' listed in reports (for ALL/LABEL orders)
Flying units now move 6 as they are supposed to, not 8 as in Nylandor.
Using an ! before an order will suppress run-time errors in most cases other than DESTROY, TAX, PILLAGE, ENTER, LEAVE, GUARD. [HAVE HAD SOME TESTGAME PROBLEMS HERE, IF YOU TRY IT PLEASE CHECK FOR/REPORT ANY BUGS!]
PROMOTE now works in the open.
