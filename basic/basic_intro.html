  Atlantis is an open-ended computer moderated fantasy game for any
  number of players. Players may attempt to carve out huge empires,
  become master magicians, intrepid explorers, rich traders or any other
  career that comes to mind. There is no declared winner of the game;
  players set their own objectives, and one can join at any time.
