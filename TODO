** Architecture
   -- Improve the item/hex editor [low priority]
   -- I'd like to add some code that will do a bit of validation on a
      rule-set, and make sure it isn't broken.
   -- Rework data storage so game files refer to items, etc. by abbreviation,
      rather than array index. Remove all array indices from game files.
   -- Move all ruleset static data to human readable (and editable) files
   -- Localise all strings, to allow for internationalisation 

** Combat
   -- Consider a gamedef which keeps tactics skill (and combat skills?)
      hidden from combatants.  (I personally think this a bad idea, but it
      was suggested, thus goes on this list)
   -- Consider hiding battle details from units which are completely wiped
      out?  [You know a battle occured, but no details of the enemy forces].
      Again, I suspect rumors travel (ie, the peasants in the area that saw
      the battle talk and the word of their strenght spreads).   Given that
      generating *inaccurate* reports would be a royal pain, I will probably
      leave this be.
   -- Add more info to battle reports. Need some discussion on what might
      be good items to include.
   -- Consider a gamedef which has monsters only give silver as loot,
      never items (maybe up the amount of silver given slightly under this
	  option)
   -- Consider having specific types of wandering monsters carrying
      specific types of armor/weapons (such as pirates or skeleton or
	  kobolds).  Possibly make those monsters not give normal loot, but
	  only the stuff they carried.
   -- Add a gamedef to have rout based on total number of hits on a side
      rather than on total number of creatures (men/monsters) on a side?

** Error messages
   -- It would be nice to have 'overwriting' errors only occur when the
      order being overridden was non repeating.

** Items
   -- Consider adding the ability to produce trade goods.
   -- Consider Duergar's war horses
   -- Consider having use'd items [i.e., items which are utilised by a USE
      order; may be part of an expanded magic system].
   -- Consider possible tools for increasing building (and ship) production.


** Orders
   -- Consider more complicated GIVE processing of 'GIVE ALL EXCEPT .....'
      [I personally believe this will be a royal pain, but if someone
      submits me a patch, I'll consider it.]
   -- Add an 'EJECT' order to allow a building owner to move a unit out
      of a structure it owns. [Make sure it cannot be used to drown a unit
	  at sea]

** Orders, Conditional
   -- Consider having 'conditional orders' specifically 'AT x,y,z'. 
      [I think that with the advent of the TURN/ENDTURN order this is
      less useful, especially as implementing this 'correctly' would require
      having the ability to run instant orders at the start of each movement
      phase, which is *not* something I wish to begin doing, at least not
      in the 4.0 series of Atlantis.]

** Rules
   -- Gamedef to handle various options around combat/weapons/bows for taxing
      [This would allow the GM to say that combat skill is required for 
	  taxing/pillaging, or that a weapon (+needed skill if any) is required,
	  or that the current situation of either a weapon (+needed skill if
	  any) or combat skill
   -- Gamedefs for various economy options. (far future) [No longer even
      sure what the discussion was which sparked this TODO list item.  Anyone
      want to search the list archives and refresh my memory?]
   -- Consider some sorts of dangers for production
   -- Consider building specific skills. [Meaning here that there are skills
      which could only be learned in that specific location.  Requested for
	  Ceran]
   -- Consider non-teachable skills. [Again, requested by Ceran as a way of
      having skills which are only learnable through specific game actions
	  or events (ie, GM intervention or the buildings in the last bullet and
	  not transferrable to all units).]
   -- Consider skill improvement through use. [This has gone around a couple
      of times.. I think it would be very very hard to do 'right' and causes
	  more problems than it solves.  Probably not something I'll do, but it
	  is something for people to consider if they want. (and if they want it
	  to code it and submit it to me under a gamedef)]
   -- Unit grouping.
   -- Add option for entertain being an instant order.
   -- Consider having allied units tagged as a '=' instead of a '-'. (extend
      to all different stances). Possibly make that unit tagging a player
	  option if it can be done with minimal hassle for client authors.
   -- Add a 'MAINTAINONLY' flag to buildings so that a building can decay and
      be kept up, but cannot be constructed. (requested for Ceran)
   -- Add ability to set stances versus specific units, not just factions
      [This would allow you to be unfriendly to a faction but still allow
	  specific unit ambassadors to travel through your lands, or trade with
	  you, or what not.   Right now, it's all or nothing against a faction
	  and this would push the granularity down a level.]
   -- Consider having buildings which require specific items/skills to enter.
      [Suggested/requested by Ben Lloyd (I think).  Basically, gives a way to
	  add some role-playing elements to the game in the forms of quests --
	  especially if combined with the early suggestion about non-teachable
	  skills.]
   -- Make monster movement only choose among viable exits [Perhaps with
      a bias against moving back where you came from.  Also make sure to
	  leave a percentage chance for staying put]
   -- Figure out how an autoclaim option for studying could be made to work
      [Tom Alsen suggested a 'POOL' command which allows you to pool money
	  in a hex for things like studying, upkeep, purchases, etc]
   -- Consider allowing FP maximums per category (configurable by gamedef)
      as well as making the game more easily handle higher FP total maximums.
	  (currently the total max number of Faction points is variable, but in
	  order for it to actually 'work' you need to change game-specific stuff)

** Rules, food
   -- Consider requiring both food and pay for upkeep (make upkeep more
      flexible in general).  Someone supplied a patch to allow a leader to
      only eat 1 (grain/livestock/fish) instead of 1 per 10 SILV upkeep.
      That would be a nice option to support as well, but to do so (as well)
      as allow old behaviour requires flexibility.
   -- Consider allowing luxury food items (chocolate, vodka, cavier) to be
      able to be eaten.  Again, don't think this is a good idea, but will
      at least think on it.
   -- Consider having a second stage of food production that takes 'raw'
      food (such as livestock/grain/fish) and produces a processed food
	  via a skill.  This makes food items actually useful for more than
	  selling/growing cities, especially if a raw item produces multiple
	  processed foods (more efficient per raw food with higher skill?)
	  Perhaps go the Lorenai route and have buildings/skills combinations
	  which enable this (baking grain into food only works for units with
	  the BAKE skill in a bakery structure)

** Skills
   -- Merchant skill (limited number of merchents)/Limited number
      of tacticians/generals? [The thought on the Merchant skill is that
	  a unit with the merchant skill could buy/sell items at a profit of
	  (for example) 10% of the listed price times his skill level, so a
	  level 5 merchant would be able to buy items from a city at 50% of
	  the listed value and sell them for 150% of the listed value.  Having
	  that unlimited seemed unbalancing, so I figured limiting it (much as
	  total number of mages are limited to mage factiosn) based on number
	  of trade points.  The General/tactician option is a possible way to
	  impose a small limit on war factions, which are pretty powerful as
	  well.  It would limit the number of units you could have which knew
	  tactics based on the number of war points.  As always, these would
	  be gamedef options as to whether they would be enabled and the
	  actual numbers of merchants or tacticians would be tweakable in the
	  same way the number of mages is tweakeable now (by editing the function
	  in extra.cpp)]
   -- Consider the use of buildings as skill boosters for some skills.
      [Craig had initially suggested  a shipyard which gave the first 20
	  men in it a +1 boost to SHIP, but realized that this wouldn't work
	  as when they started construction of the ship they'd leave the
	  building and enter the new ship, but it might be useful in other
	  contexts -- such as horsemen in a stable or farmers in a farm]
	  [This would probably be new buildings rather than the existing ones
	  since total produce boosters are useful as well]

** Spells/Magic
   -- Add more items so that apprentices are actually useful. [Tom suggested
      that another way of making apprentices more useful would be to allow
	  them to learn magic skills, but none above level 2.. This would take
	  a bit more work, but is a valid option]
   -- rethink some of the current spells. [Az's beastform spell]
   -- consider having summoned creatures drop no loot. Possibly have
      them regain (or gain) loot over time, so the longer a monster is free
      the more money and stuff it has.
   -- Clean up spell system -- Damage spells have been parameterized,
      Object creation spells, summoning spells and 'other' spells still
      need some sort of parameterization and genericization so that they
      can be tweaked on a game basis if desired. [This includes the handling
	  of things like the speed increase from Summon Wind]
   -- Merge Lacandon spells -- SOME work has been done on this already
      but a LOT more needs to be done before this is really doable without
      a lot of heartache and pain.

** Atlantis 5.0.0
   -- Ben Lloyd's class system should go in (probably wait on 5.0.0)
   -- Move String and List over to using a STL implementation
   -- Reconsider XML report generation.
