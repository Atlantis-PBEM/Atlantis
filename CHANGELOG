Changes from 4.0.4 -> 4.0.5
-------------------------------------------------
   -- Merged 4.0.4c and Realms of Arcane Codebases
   -- Merged in some parts of Lacandon conquest
   -- Fairly extensive reorganization of the source code.
   -- Small fix to make discontinuities in the UW maze less.
   -- Added ability to disable items.
   -- Some changes for Wyreth
   -- Changes for greater flexibility
   -- Many new options in gamedefs structure.

Changes from 4.0.5 -> 4.0.6
--------------------------------------------------
   -- Added FIND ALL command supplied by Tzarg (Tom Alsen)
   -- Reworked enabling/disabling of items to better preserve old feel.
   -- Various small bugfixes.
   -- Added worldname to the gamedefs structure (used for creating the
      names for the nexus and oceans as well as some spell texts)
   -- Added NEXUS_GATE gamedef to allow a one-way gate directly out of the
      nexus via gate lore.   There is no actual gate so people cannot in
      fact return to the nexus once leaving.
   -- Added code to make a starting city into just a rich city (with
      limited items available) if the city guards are taken out when
      SAFE_START_CITIES is false.   Once this occurs the unlimited goods
      are gone for good.
   -- Added MORE_PROFITABLE_TRADE_GOODS option to gamedefs.   If this is
      enabled the selling price for a trade good in a city ranges from 60-114
      and the price a city will pay ranges from 150-210.   If it is not
      enabled, the price ranges from 60-90 for selling and from 90-120 for
      buying.  This option is not on by default.
   -- Added quite a few options to help Georg Gottschalk with Ceran
   -- Added more ceran things to support Georg
   -- Fixed a bug whereby a unit which studied a mage skill but failed to
      study due to insufficient funds was still marked (and counted) as a
      mage.
   -- Fixed a bug that allowed units apprentices to become mages and vice
      versa without needing to FORGET first.
   -- Guarding units see who they forbid entry too.
   -- A unit forbidden entry (or the guarding unit) will see the faction of
      the unit that forbid them (or that they forbid) if they have sufficient
      observation of if the unit is revealing faction.
   -- Added BATTLE_FACTION_INFO option in gamedefs.   If this is true, then
      units involved in a battle will display their faction information IF
      *ANY* unit on the opposite side has sufficent OBSE to see it.   The
      reason this is an option (unlike the guarding units one) is that the
      same battle report is sent to non-involved observers of the battle.
      Due to the way the battle information is stored, it is not possible to
      customize this info per-faction seeing.
   -- Fixed a bug where a failed build incremented the building sequence
      number leading to a method whereby a region could be made deliberately
      unusable for building.
   -- Increased the range on the days of skill so that it shouldn't wrap
      to negatives.  Overflow sucks.
   -- Changed the message when no spoils are gained in a battle to
      'Spoils: none.' to alleviate problems with clients that didn't bother
      to figure out that the message used to be 'No spoils'.  Besides, a
      consistant format is good.
   -- Implemented WITHDRAW order, making unlimited markets unnecessary.
      This order is not enabled by default (enable via ALLOW_WITHDRAW in
      gamedefs.h).   If this option is enabled, the world building code will
      not build unlimited markets in the starting city, but will build regular
      markets instead (it has no effect on starting city markets after world
      generation).
   -- Fixed bug in production of BAGS that was giving all bag producers a +2
      skill level bonus.
   -- Spinning wheels now correctly help bag production.
   -- Implemented NOSPOILS flag
   -- Added some items that Tom Alsen (Tzarg) had added to a custom game.
      Some of these items have been slightly modified.
   -- Modified production code to allow an item to be built out of two items.
      When an item has two inputs, it takes man-months equal to the sum of
      the number of input units.  (For instance, if a battle axe takes 1
      unit of wood and 1 unit of iron to manufacture, then it takes 2
      man-months to produce each one)
   -- Cleaned up the city/town/village renaming code a bit (Thanks to Tom
      Alsen).  Also added a CITY_RENAME_COST, which if not zero is used as
      a multiply against the city level (1 == village, 2==town, 3==city)
      as a cost for renaming the city.
   -- Added more room for monster lairs (each terrain can now host up to
      1 of 6 instead of 1 of 4 different types of lairs).
   -- NEW RULE: A unit cannot steal from or assassinate a unit which it
      it unable to see.  A unit may not GIVE items to a unit it cannot see
      unless that unit's faction sees the giver as friendly.
   -- Added room for one additional coastal and one additional non-coastal
      race in each of the terrain type definitions.
   -- Fixed bug with a reversed sign in road building.
   -- Patch from Tom Alsen (Tzarg) to catch if unit sequence numbers got
      foobar'd and to at least attempt to repair it.   Side effect of this
      is that any orders for the repaired unit get lost, but that is
      unavoidable.  It also warns the GM so that he can look into it and
      hopefully fix it.
   -- Added a 'similar_type' to the TerrainDefs structure so that spells
      (such as wolf-lore) worked correctly with the Ceran types and the
      conquest types enabled.  There are possibly other places where the
      similar_type should be used instead of the direct type.
   -- Added healing potions which are made from mushrooms (a new resource)
      and which can be carried along with armies. Each potion acts as a
      healer of skill level 1.
   -- Implemented GIVE [unit] ALL [item] and GIVE [unit] ALL [item]
      EXCEPT [amount].   Updated the rules to reflect the changes.

Changes from 4.0.6 -> 4.0.7
--------------------------------------------------
   -- Added TAX_PILLAGE_MONTH_LONG gamedef.  If this is set to one, then
      taxing and pillaging are month-long orders.  The AUTOTAX flag, when
      this is set, is still used, but now what it means is that a unit
      with this flag will tax if a) no other orders have been given for
      the unit and b) it is capable of taxing.  (IE, the autotax flag
      makes the units default order TAX instead of WORK)
   -- Fixed bug that caused monster generation to hang if unable to generate
      monsters because all of them were disabled.
   -- Fixed a typo which had storm giants and cloud giants having the same tag
   -- Fixed up the code slightly so that if you defined NEXUS_IS_CITY it
      actually gives the nexus some sort of items and population.
   -- Fixed up the code slightly so that starting citys aren't created if you
      set TOWNS_EXIST to false.
   -- Fixed up the code so that gates aren't created and gate lore is disabled
      if GATES_EXIST is set to false.
   -- Fixed bug where large maps were coring all over themselves due to
      a stack smash.  Stupid bug.
   -- Fixed another bug where regions got trashed when you managed (say
      during world creation) to create more than 10000 units in a turn.
   -- Balanced lances a bit.
   -- Now handles ultra-small worlds gracefully (either by failing to
      create the exit, or promoting some location). World creation down to
      8x8 now works.
   -- Added gamedef 'MULTI_HEX_NEXUS'.  If this is set, then on world creation
      you will be asked how many nexus hexes there should be.  The nexus
      will then be a connected strip of x hexes wide and 1 deep.   Each nexus
      hex will connect to 4 cities and to the two adjacent nexus hexes.
      New players will be started in a random nexus hex.   This does hinder
      alliances somewhat as may be harder for them to get to the same place
      in order to move to the same starting city.
   -- Fixed bug in combat where if all of the attackers unit in a hex were
      set avoid, the attacker could (in contradiction to the rules) issue
      an attack against an ally.
   -- Fixed bug where FORCE Shield did not protect agaisnt bow attacks.
      Force shield changed to protect against all ranged weapon attacks.
   -- Fixed bug which caused GCC v3.0 to not compile atlantis
   -- Moved TODO list to it's own file
   -- Modified the mount selection code so that if you had a region that
      only allows riding mounts and you have a mount that has ride but not
      fly it still gets correctly selected.
   -- If a region only allows riding but not flying mounts (non currently)
      then a flying mount used in that region will be restricted to the
      maxRiding bonus defined in the MountType structure.
   -- Fixed bug in ForgetSkill where a unit which was an Apprentice and
      forgot any skill which made them an apprentice (only MANIPULATION
      currently) they didn't get unmarked as an apprentice.  (Thanks to
      Ben Lloyd for pointing that out)
   -- Fixed a bug in GIVE ALL EXCEPT which caused a wierdness when you
      tried to give more than you had.
   -- Fixed bug with CanStudy which showed disabled skills.
   -- Fixed bug with DBOWs taking down force shields.  Only *spells* take
      down shields.
   -- Updated skillshows with the patch provided by Andrew Zhilenko which
   -- Patched ADVANCE battle bugs reported by Andrew Zhilenko
      <andrew@nextra.cz>
      makes the logic in there cleaner.
   -- Added Georg Gottschalks 'volcano' terrain.  It's a bit odd in that
      it requires flying to get into (move cost of 6) BUT mounts within it
      only get a max of riding mounts bonus. (IE, a WING gets a max 3 riding
      bonus in it due to trecherous terrain)
   -- Tweaked the quantities of Admantium by default.
   -- Added Javelin weapon designed by Terho T. Uotila
      <ttuotila@cc.helsinki.fi>, who wanted a cheap ranged weapon.
   -- Various small fixes provided by Ben Lloyd
   -- Fixed WITHDRAW <item> to be the same as WITHDRAW 1 <item>
   -- Some other small fixes from Ben Lloyd. <Ben.Lloyd.1@uni.massey.ac.nz>
   -- Increased the number of possible products per hex from 5 to 7.
   -- Added Georg Gottschalks underdeep and multi-level underworld and gems.
   -- Removed a whole bunch of unused ifdefs from the code
   -- Added new combat system from Tom Alsen
   -- Reorganized terrain data structures to make future extension of number
      of resources, lairs, races easier.
   -- Changed lair percent to be percent of terrain type which has lair
      rather than percent chance for each type of lair.
   -- Reorganized as many of the rest of the datastructures as I could get
      my hands on to do similar stuff to what I did to the terrain data
      structs.
   -- Added some fields in the item structures to handle crafting items by
      magic.  Down with special cases.  Some work still needs to be done
      here.
   -- Made road decay into more generic building decay and extended the
      building definition structure to handle it.
   -- Fixed a long standing bug.  The rules state that a guarding unit will
      prevent ALL units of any faction other than the owner from pillaging.
      The code up until now had been implementing it as any unit of a
      nuetral or worse stance faction.  This has been fixed.
   -- Added item and object descriptions.  Redid skill descriptions.
   -- Made horse/wagon generic rather than hardcoded. 
   -- Removed the special case of earthquakes not affecting MFORTRESS.  This
      is now handled by a NOEARTHQUAKE flags on the object in the ObjectDefs
      structure.
   -- Added skillflag SLOWSTUDY.  If you modify a skill to have this flag,
      a month of study will only produce 15 days of learning in the skill.
      This is cumulative with non-tower penalty for magic skills over level 2.
   -- Fixed a bug which could potentially result in GUARD_ADVANCE being left
      set on a unit across turns.
   -- Fixed a bug in calculating planar distances around the east/west
      boundary.
   -- Added some 'commands' allowable in the Players.in file which allow the
      GM to give a faction custom-made units, or to give existing units of
      that faction various skills or items (or to take them away).  It also
      allows the GM to force some orders to be executed by specific units.
   -- Added a new itemflag NOMARKET, which prevents an item from ever showing
      up in a city market (either wanted or for sale).
   -- Added code to allow magic items into the markets on world creation.  All
      magic items currently are NOMARKET, so there will by default be no
      change.
   -- Moved some items from NORMAL to ADVANCED (lance and pike) and moved
      some items from MAGIC to ADVANCED (and added NOMARKET) (admantium items,
      improved mithril armor, super bows).
   -- Modified Axes from having Hammers boost their production to having
      Axes boost their production by default.  This makes them consistant with
      other items made from wood rather than being the exception.
   -- Added (disabled) resource enhancing buildings for all resources that
      didn't yet have one.

Changes from 4.0.7 -> 4.0.8
--------------------------------------------------
   -- Added the BUILD HELP <unit> syntax to allow two units to collaborate
      on creating an object even during the first turn it is being built.
   -- Added BUY ALL and SELL ALL commands.  SELL ALL will attempt to sell
      all of an item that you can.  BUY ALL will attempt to buy as many of
      an item as you can.
   -- Modified the 'Item:' players.in command to give the unit information
      about the new item they own if they haven't already seen it.
   -- Fixed a bug in setting a unit as MAGE when given skills via the GM
      option.
   -- Fixed a bug where the game editor could give out disabled items.
   -- Fixed a bug in the game editor to mark a unit as having owned an item.
   -- Fixed a bug in the save code which caused items to be shown every turn
      instead of just the first turn
   -- Fixed where FORCE_SHIELD versus ranged attacks got broken in the
      rewrite of the combat system.
   -- Fixed bug.  A unit with wolves/eagles/dragons which LOST the
      ability to control them (either via having the mage assassinated or
      via the mage FORGETing the skill) now loses the creatures.
   -- Added ability to control a factions starting location and whether or
      no the 'traditional' starting unit is created to the players.in file.
   -- Added more objects and stuff for Ceran
   -- Fixed bug which allowed two guard units to spring up in a city.
   -- Fixed problems with fileio.cpp on win32
   -- RE-FIXED bug with city guards
   -- Fixed a bug where a disabled item/skill/object was still be accepted
      by the checker.
   -- Applied modified version of maximum mages per building patch submitted
      by Paul Mehrer <paul.mehrer@web.de>
   -- Fixed a bug in the EASIER_UNDERWORLD code pointed out by
      Stephen Baillie (baillie@cs.mu.oz.au) which caused it to only work on
      level 0-2 inclusive.
   -- Fixed a bug in IMPROVED_FARSIGHT code which was pointed out by Stephen
      Baillie (baillie@cs.mu.oz.au) which caused it give odd results if
      multiple mages from the same faction with different skills cast farsight
      on the same hex during a turn.
   -- Fixed bug in BUILD HELP which caused an infinite loop when the helper
      was already in the building to be helped with.
   -- Fixed bug in NOSPOILS code which caused an infinite loop if no army
      unit would accept spoils.
   -- Fixed another bug in the NOSPOILS code.  NOSPOILS was supposed to still
      allow 0 weight and weight < walking capacity items to be aquired.  It
      wasn't.
   -- Fixed a bug where WITHDRAW was not being noted as an invalid order if
      the ALLOW_WITHDRAW gamedef was not set.
   -- Fixed a bug with GM_REPORT which caused it not to work except on turn 1.
   -- Added transit patch submitted by Stephen Baillie <baillie@cs.mu.OZ.AU>.
      This patch enables the GM to show hex information to units which pass
      through a hex but do not end the turn there.  The bits of information
      which are shown are completely selectable from an enumeration in
      gamedefs.h and default to the current behaviour (no reports).
      WARNING: In an attempt to prevent clients from breaking, if you show
      reports but do not show a specific piece of information (ie, wages or
      entertainment or resources) the hex report will appear as if the hex
      has NONE of that type of information (ie, wages 0, or Products: none).
      So, be careful when turning this on as it COULD give your players a
      false sense of having accurate data when they do not!
   -- Added the 'harp' item created by Ceran II
   -- Did a lot of work to handle spell damages and effects in a
      customizable manner.
   -- Moved the makefiles out of the subdirectories and coallesced them into
      one makefile at the top level which can be used to build the various
      games.  By default the 'standard' game is built.
   -- Removed some of the 'XXX' (fixme) comments from the code.   Still more
      to do.
   -- Reworked the NOSPOILS code based on the patch submitted by Tom Alsen
      <tzarg@yahoo.com>.   The new syntax is SPOILS [NONE|ALL|WALK|FLY|RIDE].
      Spoils NONE forces a unit to pick up only items with weight 0.  Spoils
      ALL is the default and allows a unit to carry any spoils.   The other
      modes will only allow a unit to pick up a given spoil if that item has
      a capacity in that mode at least equal to it's weight.

Changes from 4.0.8 -> 4.0.9
--------------------------------------------------
   -- Added a gamedef to allow markets to always show advanced items, not
      solely when a unit which has them shows up in the city.
   -- Added the 'prepare' command from Lacandon with a gamedef to enable
      it's use.
   -- Added two gamedef variables to control when a monster can advance
      rather than just move.
   -- Added a gamedef to define (for the automatic rules generation) if
      a game has the 'special email commands' (#create, #times, #rumor).
   -- Moved the generation of unlimited items in start cities under
      'START_CITIES_START_UNLIMITED' gamedef.  This allows correct rules
      generation and more GM options.
   -- Added automatic generation of rules files from the gamedefs and
      internal tables.
   -- Split armor-piercing attacks into armor-piercing, energy, spirit and
      weather. Armor can now protect differently against these. I'm not sure
      the original new combat system is mentioned in this change log, but the
      split is an addition to that. Patch submitted by Tom Alsen
      <tzarg@yahoo.com>
   -- Added WEAPON [itemlist] and ARMOR [itemlist] commands, which allow
      a unit to set a preferred weapon and armor list. This is enabled
      by the USE_WEAPON_ARMOR_COMMAND gamedef. Patch submitted by Tom
      Alsen <tzarg@yahoo.com>
   -- Added PROPORTIONAL_AMTS_USAGE flag. When set, if an assassin targets
      a unit with more men than amulets of true seeing, there is a chance
      that he picks a man with an AMTS, and the attempt is foiled.  When
      this gamedef is unset, the attempt will always succeed.  Patch
      submitted by Tom Alsen <tzarg@yahoo.com>.
   -- New rule: Assassins with RINGs of invisibility cannot get amulets of
      true seeing in spoils (otherwise the assassination would have been
      prevented) [This is needed for the PROPORTIONAL_AMTS_USAGE to work,
      but also applies when that gamedef is clear.] Patch submitted by
      Tom Alsen <tzarg@yahoo.com>.
   -- Fixed a hang when attempting to write report files which already exist.
      It now just silently doesn't write them.
   -- Added 'EXCHANGE' order which allows two units to trade items
      regardless of faction stances.  This is safe (unlike GIVE) since both
      units must enter complimentary items.  For example, if unit 12221 and
      15333 wanted to trade 10 LBOW for 1000 SILV, unit 15333 would enter
      'EXCHANGE 12221 1000 SILV 10 LBOW' and unit 12221 would enter
      'EXCHANGE 15333 10 LBOW 1000 SILV'.  Since the quantity and the items
      must match or the trade doesn't occur, this is safe even for neutral
      or unfriendly stanced factions.  This patch was submitted by Nick
      Hoggard <nickhoggard@clear.net.nz>.
   -- Added a patch by Nick Hoggard <nickhoggarg@clear.net.nz> implementing
      the 'TURN' order.  This order allows pre-specification of orders for
      turns in the future as well as constructing loops of orders based on
      turns.  See the rules for details.
   -- Added the implementation of 'GIVE ALL <item class>'.  The original
      implementation was done by Tom Alsen <tzarg@yahoo.com> for Blitzgame
      and was merged over.
   -- Fixed BUILD HELP so that the unit you are helping must consider you
      at least friendly before it will allow you to help build the structure.
      The reason for this is to prevent unauthorized entry into a building.
   -- Added message distinguishing move failure due to overburdened from 
      move failure due to no more movement points.
   -- Redid ParseItem a bit (made it three different functions) to allow
      specific features to GM and push some of the error checking down
      into the function.  This hopefully fixes a bug in Ceran II where
      someone was trying to buy goblins (which are a race there as well as
      a monster) and failing because it was finding the monster before the
      race in the item list.  ParseGiveableItem is now used by BUY, SELL,
      GIVE, and EXCHANGE.  ParseEnabledItem is used by the rest of the orders
      processing routines, and ParseAllItems is used by the GM 'player.in'
      file routines which give items to players. ParseEnabled and ParseAll
      can still get confused by items with the same name, though in most
      of the cases where that currently could be a problem it won't be (as
      both of the conflicting items would be invalid in that spot anyway).
   -- When a unit is formed, it is now tagged with the forming faction and
      that is a valid alias for the rest of the turn.   This is to prevent
      the ambiguity which could crop up when dealing with units which were
      formed and given during the same turn.
   -- Fixed the swim code to give a Swims message and work with flight
      over water.  Changed item giving of dying units to not cause other
      units to drown.
   -- Fixed niggle in the swim/move code so that when a unit attempts to
      move over water when not in a structure, the ability to move is
      calculated based on swim capacity, not walking capacity.   This is
      a change asked for by Pete Christie.   It also makes sense, and is
      one step closer to having swimming be an actual movement mode in
      its own right.
   -- Fixed a bug where spoils calculation could wrap causing spoils
      earned to be a negative value of an object.
   -- Fixed a bug where a disabled skill would be shown in the information
      about a race which had that skill as a specialty.
   -- Did a bit of grubbing around in the old atlantisproject dejanews
      archives and added a few ideas from there to the TODO list.
   -- Started looking at some of the older atlantisdev postings [pre my
      joining the list] and found a couple of good ideas there too.  The
      big problem is how long it would take me to completely go through
      that archive.  Anyone want to take that on and summarize for me
      ideas/extensions that have been proposed so they can be added to the
      todo list to at least consider? [This would probably also help to
      attach atlantisdev post articles to various todo list items, which
      has been requested].
   -- Fixed a bug where ADVANCE orders were combined together during the
      orders checker, but not during the actual game run.
   -- Added GIVE XXX ALL ITEMS which gives them everything, *including men*
      in one fell swoop!
   -- Fixed a bug where roads weren't used to calculate move to allow armies
      to help adjacent hexes.

Changes from 4.0.9 -> 4.0.10
--------------------------------------------------
   -- Fixed a bug where weapon length affected ranged weapons.
   -- Fixed a bug where at world generation time, one too few gates was
      generated, possibly resulting in a starting city with no gate.
   -- Fixed a bug where battle items which were not usable (due to having
      a combat spell set, or due to not being a mage and having a mage-only
      item) being checked for use caused the items to be lost to the unit.
   -- Fixed bug where weapon length affected damage spells as well.
   -- Fixed bug which caused AMTS protection vs RING to fail when the # of
      AMTS was identical to the number of men in the unit.
   -- Fixed two small display glitch bugs as reported by Jason Cortina.
   -- Fixed riding bonus for archers bug.  Added new weapontype flags of
      RIDINGBONUS and RIDINGBONUSDEFENSE [Implemented by Tom Alsen]
   -- Implemented no spoils from summoned monsters which are released for
      some number of turns.  Added gamedefs of MONSTER_NO_SPOILS (how many
      turns a summoned monster has no spoils, -1 for infinity) and
      MONSTER_SPOILS_RECOVERY (how many turns after the NO_SPOILS turns
      until it is equivalent to a non-summoned monster).  [Implemented
      by Tom Alsen, who recommends values of 3 and 9 respectively]
   -- Added NUM_ATTACKS_HALF_SKILL.  [Implemented by Tom Alsen, who
      recommends using this for DBOW and RUNE, and NUM_ATTACKS_HALF_SKILL+1
      for SBOW].
   -- Added gamedef MAX_ASSASSIN_FREE_ATTACKS. [Implemented by Tom Alsen
      who recommends a value of 2].  If set, this will limit the number of
      attacks in the free round off assassination to that value.
   -- Added gamedef RELEASE_MONSTERS. If set, enables 'GIVE 0 <num>
      <monster>' for any monster and will create wandering monsters from
      the ones released or ones that are lost control of (this makes dragons
      eagles and wolves similar to demons and such if this gamedef is
      enabled).  [Implemented by Tom Alsen]
   -- Added gamedef CHECK_MONSTER_CONTROL_MID_TURN to check for demons
      breaking free and zombie decay in mid-turn (before move) rather than
      at the end of move.  [Implemented by Tom Alsen].  This makes it
      harder to have mages sending in directed balrog missiles [for
      instance] if it is set.
   -- Added WEATHER_LORE as a castable spell. Use CAST Weather_Lore 
      [REGION <x> <y>] to predict the weather for 3,6 and 12 months at
      levels 1,3 and 5 respectively. Range is same as Farsight -
      4*level*level. [Implemented by Tom Alsen]
   -- Made spell range checking more generic.  There are now methods for
      pre- and post-processing spell ranges.  Teleport, Farsight and
      Weather Lore now use this mechanism [Implemented by Tom Alsen]
   -- Added CLEAR_SKIES_REGION gamedef to allow Clear Skies to be cast as
      a ranged spell at range 2*level*level.  [Implemented by Tom Alsen].
   -- Boats which have only monster/creatures on board will now sink.
      [no more leaving skeleton crews around [pun intended]]
   -- Unit with no physical weapons are assumed to have 'SHORT' weapons.
   -- Added alternative rout types as suggested and implemented by Karl
      Castle <kcastle@webzone.net.au>.  The new gamedef which controls
      this is called ARMY_ROUT.  Default is ARMY_ROUT_FIGURES which behaves
      identically to what we have now.  Other options are
      ARMY_ROUT_HITS_INDIVIDUAL and ARMY_ROUT_HITS_FIGURE.  These two are
      very similar in that they are both based on total hits in a unit.
      The difference is that ARMY_ROUT_HITS_INDIVIDUAL tracks each hitpoint
      individually and the army routs if the total damage done is more
      than 1/2 the total number of hits.  This means (say you have a dragon
      and a mage (for a total of 51 hits)) that the army will rout if the
      dragon takes 26 hits even though neither unit might actually have
      died.  The other option, ARMY_ROUT_HITS_FIGURE only subtracts the hits
      from the total when the figure actually is killed, so in the example
      of 1 mage and 1 dragon, the battle would continue until the dragon
      was dead, regardless of when (or if) the mage was killed.
   -- Added RangeType setup to make ranges customizable. This should make
      the Lacandon spells fully implementable.
   -- The CLEAR_SKIES castable at range stuff is now doable by setting the
      rangeIndex on S_CLEAR_SKIES to RANGE_CLEAR_SKIES and then modifying
      the values for RANGE_CLEAR_SKIES.
   -- Fixed planar scaling so that all levels were scaled to what they should
      be, not always *2 for levels other than surface.
   -- Fixed a bug which caused a crash in the orders checker if you had a
      bogus form order and did NOT have either an ENDFORM of #END order in
      your orderset after that bogus form.
   -- Fixed a bug which caused a crash if you built a road in a direction
      where there was no adjacent hex.
   -- Fixed a bug in unit drowning when they left a boat.
   -- Fixed a bug in combat where the rules and code differed.  Code now
      follows the rules.
   -- Fixed a bug in display of info about shield effects generated by items.
   -- Fixed bug in forlist during assassination which caused assassinations
      to stop if the person you assassinated was directly below you in the
      unit list in the object.
   -- Tom Alsen added code to Blitzgame allowing monsters to regenerate hits
      during combat.  I have merged this code into the main base under a
      configuration option.
   -- Patch for multiple types of taxing behaviour controlling who is
      allowed to tax.  Patch submitted by Stephen Baillie.
   -- Fixed a bug in BUY/SELL where two buys or sells of the same item would
      cause the second to fail with an error.
   -- Fixed another instance of the missing ENDFORM order which caused a
      crash.
   -- Added EVICT order as submitted by Peter Rayner
      <wacky_wizard001@hotmail.com> with slight modifications.
   -- Fixed bugs in combat where riding skill was being counted twice in
      defence, and ranged weapons were using COMB skill for attack strength.
   -- Fixed bug in EVICT code that caused a segmentation fault
   -- Added SKILL_PRACTICE_AMOUNT and associated code all over the place
      to allow skills to improve with practice.  A unit may improve at
      most one skill per month, and will only improve skills they already
      have.  Using a skill counts as practicing its prerequisites if they
      need to be impoved before the skill can advance further.  I suggest
      a value of 5 for SKILL_PRACTICE_AMOUNT.
   -- Fixed a bug where CanSee was not taking account of MIND skill.
   -- Modified combat acquisition algorithm for special attacks so that
      they will always find an appropriate target if one exists.
   -- Fixed a bug where unmounted units were being matched in the effect
      matching code for MOUNTIF.
   -- Cleaned up a small section of rules for clarity.
   -- Fixed up a bug with two sell orders for the same item which did
      insufficient checking that you could sell both quantities.  This
      bug existed for a while but never showed up because of the bug
      with multiple sells of the same item which I fixed a few weeks ago.
   -- Changed MOVE and SAIL so that if the unit runs out of movement
      points, the remaining moves are added to the front of the TURN
      queue.  This allows caravans using @TURN to work properly despite
      weather changing move costs.  Also fixed a bug where a single
      @TURN command would be lost because of a pointer being reused.
   -- Modified TURN/ENDTURN processing to cope with arbitrarily deep
      TURN and FORM nesting, and cleaned up the error handling.
   -- Moved the correlation between faction points and what they give
      you from being hardcoded in extra.cpp to an array in rules.cpp.
   -- Small fix so that all items (even non-give) can actually be discarded.
   -- Added check that there is actually an active unit when parsing TURN
      and ENDTURN orders.  Fixes segfault.
   -- Fixed bugs in orders checker where it was trying to do a
      unit->Error() where it should have been doing ParseError() since
      unit isn't valid in the orders checker.
   -- Applied patch from Jan Rietema <ravanrooke@yahoo.de> providing a large
      amount more configurability in the world generation process.
   -- Changed template generation to understand the terrain types again
      after the previous fix.
   -- Added gamedefs to control the minimum and maximum amounts of food
      that a unit requires for maintenance, and the value of food for
      maintenance.
   -- Added a processed food item (FOOD), cooking skill and Create Food
      spell to go with the possibility of requiring food for upkeep.
      Made food buyable in all town markets.
   -- Made it so that shield items didn't need to be PREPARED in a game with
      USE_PREPARE_COMMAND set and verified that non-prepared items got
      returned.
   -- Fixed display of hits/regen to show unit number and creature in unit
      which took the damage.
   -- Fixed bug in magic studying in protected buildings under LIMITED_MAGES
      case as reported by Vitauts Stochka <vit@dau.lv>
   -- Fixed empty object bug reported by Vitauts Stochka <vit@dau.lv>
   -- Added unit weight/capacity patch from Ales Privetivy <ales@ucw.cz>
   -- Added patch from Jan Rietema <ravanrooke@yahoo.de> to conditionally
      prevent ships from sailing through single-hex land-masses.
   -- Fixed a bug in the cross-level teleport stuff (if allowed) which caused
      the penalty to be a flat value rather than per difference in level.
   -- Fixed a bug in teleport and such which allowed entry into and out of
      the Abyss (and viewing it via farsight and such).  Bad JT, no biscuit.
      Thanks AZ for pointing it out.
      
Changes from 4.0.10 -> 4.0.10a
--------------------------------------------------
   -- Fixed bug in conquest map generation caused by terrain change patch
   -- Fixed potential namespace collision on 'fill' in template.cpp

Changes from 4.0.10a -> 4.0.10b
--------------------------------------------------
   -- Fixed bug with extremely large worlds and more than 10000 units
   -- Fixed bug with small worlds/levels where a town was less than 9
      hexes from *both* poles AND LESS_ARTIC_TOWNS was enabled.  This
      caused very large negative/positive numbers for wages and such.
   -- Fixed a bug in random number generation when getrandom was called
      on a negative number (found while fixing the one above)
   -- Fixed a potential crash when evicting someone who had already
      left the building.
   -- Fixed a couple of typos in the generated rules.

Changes from 4.0.10b -> 4.0.10c
--------------------------------------------------
   -- Fixed probability of town generation bug from Jan's patch.
   -- Fixed bug in movement costs when WEATHER_EXISTS was 0.
   -- Added 'Spoils: none' line to indecisive battles to make ACB happier
   -- Fixed segfault in skill starvation code.

Changes from 4.0.10c -> 4.0.10d
--------------------------------------------------
   -- Fixed a coredump when a region affecting spell was used on a z level
      that was out of range.  Bad range-check.. bad!
   -- Fixed misleading damage messages on monsters.
   -- Fixed a bug where gluttony became a sin (under skill starvation).
   -- Fixed rounding error in pillaging 

Changes from 4.0.10d -> 4.0.10e
--------------------------------------------------
   -- Fixed missing parenthesis in calculating rename cost of cities.
   -- Fixed setup error in city markets (wasn't obeying the directive
      CITY_MARKET_NORMAL_AMT in one case)
   -- Fixed bug in AString::value() where an excessively large number
      could be used to overflow an integer into a negative and thus
      cause some very wierd effects (such as creating items out of
      nothing)
   -- Fixed a bug where a faction could get more apprentices than they
      should be allowed.
   -- Fixed bug in tax being a month-long order and issuing the 'tax'
      command giving an error about work overwriting and then the unit
      working instead of taxing.
   -- Fixed bug where autotax didn't work if DEFAULT_WORK_ORDER was
      disabled and the unit was submitted as part of an orderset but had
      blank orders (only when TAX_PILLAGE_MONTHLONG was set).

Changes from 4.0.10e -> 4.0.10f
--------------------------------------------------
   -- Fixed bug in practice code where non-leader units would keep trying
      to practice and generate errors even after they were at max level.

Changes from 4.0.10f -> 4.0.10g
--------------------------------------------------
   -- Changed USE_PREPARE slightly.  There is now a 'strict' and a 'normal'
      setting for USE_PREPARE.  Under strict, the READY command MUST be
      used or the unit will not use any battle items.  Under normal, the
      unit will fall back on the battle items list.

Changes from 4.0.10g -> 4.0.10h
--------------------------------------------------
   -- Fixed a bug which caused the first mage casting Earth Lore in a
      region to recieve 2*level less silver than he should.
   -- Fixed a bug where an army where all casualties were healed were
      prevented from further moves or attacks.  Full healing should mean
      no penalties.
   -- Fixed a bug in output of rules when dealing with skill-based
      maintainence.
   -- Fixed a bug dealing with the cost of non-skilled units versus skilled
      units when in a maintenance mode which requires skill based upkeep.
      Units will now pay the maximum of the skill based upkeep or the normal
      upkeep.  This means that GM's should probably *lower* the normal upkeep
      to something more reasonable than 10/20 if they are using the skill
      based upkeep unless they JUST want to penalize higher skilled leaders.

Changes from 4.0.10h -> 4.0.10i
--------------------------------------------------
   -- Fix bug where completed buildings weren't adding protection in battle.
   -- Made a small change to battle output requested by the author of
      atlaclient.
   -- Fixed a bug in building where using an enter order on the same turn as
      a build caused you to be in the wrong building to build and thus not
      actually build.
   -- Fixed a bug in construct gate which made it successful 100% of the time
      at level 1, instead of 20% at level 1 up to 100% at level 5.
   -- made all town pop functions use CITY_POP instead of local constants
   -- fixed a bug where the 'rural' hex population was taken into account
      when markets were set up, but not when market items were considered
      for their activity and effect on town growth.
   -- Markets: all except food set their amount to zero below the minimum
      pop, and the minimum amount (1/6th of total amount for trade items and
      normal items on demand) is used as soon as an item becomes available.
   -- the minimum amount of economically relevant items is set to at least
      1/6th the total (this affects games in progress).
   -- added 'staggered' markets: for more than one items of a type, an
      increasing offset is added to the minimum population of that item's
      market (so item 1 will appear at 1000+, item 2 at 1300+, item 3 at
      1600+ for instance).
   -- Fixed bug in @ENDTURN.
   -- Fixed bug with skill-based maintanence costs.

Changes from 4.0.10 -> 5.0.0
--------------------------------------------------
   -- Fixed brokeness in conquest map generation caused by terrain patch
   -- Fixed potential namespace conflict on 'fill' from template.cpp
   -- Changed function of TEMPLATE order, as well as report format:
      the TEMPLATE order information is now stored with the other faction
      details (like TIMES), in the "players" file, like so:
      Template: {off|short|long|map}
      It is left to the server to handle this item (much like the
      "SendTimes:" item in the "players" file).  During turn run, there will
      be two files produced for each faction ID:  report.ID, and template.ID .
      In cases where "off" was chosen, a "short" report will be produced
      for the faction (thus allowing your server to propagate a set of
      orders automatically [if you do that sort of thing] to the next
      turn).
   -- Fixed bug in generation of extremely large and extremely small worlds
      and levels.  Second bug was introduced by artic towns patch.
   -- Fixed bug in movement costs when WEATHER_EXISTS was 0
   -- Fixed the broken 'faction: newNoLeader' and 'startLoc:' directives.
      'Faction: new' now takes some additional parameters on the data line
      so you can say 'Faction: new' (create a normal faction),
      'Faction: new 10 10 1' (create a normal faction but put the initial
      leader in location 10,10,1 instead of nexus) or 'Faction: new noleader'
      (you can also use 'Faction: new noleader 10 10 1') which will
      create a leaderless faction (with the location if specified).  And
      you can then use the newUnit/Item/Skill commands to customize that
      unit exactly as you want.
   -- Fixed bug where nexus was an odd number of regions in multi-hex nexus.
      (courtesy of Ben Lloyd)
   -- Fixed a divide by zero bug in calculating population.  (courtesy of
      Ben Lloyd)
   -- Fixed bug where monfaction and guardfaction were not being initialized
      correctly and another where monfaction was being called as faction 2
      hardcoded (courtesy of Ben Lloyd)
   -- Fixed RunPortalLore to actually use GetTargetInRange() rather than
      calling GetDist() directly.
   -- Added "number of days taught" to output from study.
   -- Fixed misleading damage message on monsters.
   -- Fixed coredump and rangecheck when a region that was out of range was
      used in a targetted spell.
   -- Sorted item reporting [men/monsters/arms/mounts/vehicles/other/
      silver] in ItemList.
   -- Gates are closed part of the year when GATES_NOT_PERENNIAL is set to a
      value between 1 and 11 (the number of months a gate is open). Closed
      gates cannot be detected (other than by casting detect gate in the
      same region), and cannot be used except as a target gate for random
      jumps. The nexus gate is always open, as are the starting city gates
      when START_GATES_OPEN is set. Closed gates are reported as such when 
      SHOW_CLOSED_GATES is set (this gamedef was introduced to keep report
      formats consistent with what some clients' parsers might expect). If
      this is not set, the presence of closed gates will not be reported at
      all.
      Note that closing gates introduce a strategic element as not all gates
      will lead to all others (through targetted jumps anyway) - the opening
      period of both gates need to overlap to make a targetted jump possible.
   -- Fixed a bug where gluttony became a sin (under skill starvation).
   -- Save out abbreviation for items and terrain name for terrains in
      output file rather than the index.
   -- Fixed rounding error in pillaging.
   -- Fixed setup error in market.
   -- Added BANKs, Banking skill and BANK WITHDRAW & DEPOSIT.
   -- made code compile under GCC 3.2 with no warnings/errors
   -- fixed bug where monsters were not affected by invisibility cast on 
      a unit.
   -- Units will be NOCROSS by default when created.
   -- Units will only inherit AUTOTAX flag and GUARD status if they are
      combat ready.
   -- Lowered merfolk from 1000 value of spoils down to 200.  More in
      line with their difficulty.  Also lowered their spoil type to
      normal.. Pirates raised to IT_ADVANCED.
   -- Fix bug in AString::value() where integer could be overflowed into
      a negative value allowing such fun tricks as creating items out of
      nothing. (Bug reported by Sergey Budnevitch <fabler@mtu.ru>)
   -- Fixed bug in faction type changing where a faction could set magic
      5, get apprentices, and then change away from magic 5 but keep the
      apprentices.
   -- Added 'transport' and 'distribute' orders.  Transport allows movement
      between friendly units with the quartermaster skill within non-local
      transport distance and from any friendly unit within local transport
      distance to a quartermaster.  Distribute allows shipment of items
      from a quartermaster to any friendly unit within local transport
      range.  Use of these skills require the quartermaster to be located
      in a caravanserai (requires building 2/20 wood or stone to construct).
      The number of quartermasters is limited by the number of trade points.
      Use of distribute and transport counts as a trade use in the hex as
      well.  There are options to allow the level of Quartermaster skill
      to affect the non-local transport distance or the cost of shipping
      items non-locally.
   -- Fixed bug in tax being a month-long order and issuing the 'tax'
      command giving an error about work overwriting and then the unit
      working instead of taxing.
   -- Fixed bug where autotax didn't work if DEFAULT_WORK_ORDER was
      disabled and the unit was submitted as part of an orderset but had
      blank orders (only when TAX_PILLAGE_MONTHLONG was set).
   -- Fixed a bug where withdraw didn't give item info on items which the
      faction hadn't already seen the item info.
   -- GROW_RACES option to disperse races across an area at world creation
      rather than set them up hex-by-hex. This is tuneable by adjusting the
      gamedef value.
   -- PLAYER_ECONOMY: very basic ruleset for the player-run economy are in
      place.  Enabling this means that population grows or dies according to
      given space (habitat) and other factors and that the economy is
      determined by a region's development parameter. Recruitment reduces
      the population while give 0 orders increase it (no check for races
      yet). This is not yet reflected in the rules.
   -- Started work on getting rid of the hardcoded enums.  Battle Items,
      Weapons, Armors, Mounts and Men are now done, as are Effects, Specials,
      and Ranges.  They are now completely looked up based on a unique text
      key to find the one desired.
   -- Fixed a small goof in the grow races code (a race (I_VIKING for example)
      was being used as an index into the ManDefs array.  This worked fine for
      the 'base' races, but would have failed on any of the extended ones.
   -- Fixed bug in transport which didn't prevent the use of incomplete
      transport structures.
   -- Added Tony Briggs <abriggs@iinet.net.au> COASTAL_FISH patch.
   -- Initial cut at 'attribute' and hooking them up to skills/items/unit
      flags which modify them.  This will hopefully get rid of some of the
      hackishness with some hardcoded skills.
   -- Fixed riding check in GetAttackRiding to use the lowest weight man
      in the unit (for races which are not 'normal weight')
   -- Attributes now handle monsters as well, and there is a PracticeAttribute
      which knows how to practice skills which modify attributes.  This gets
      rid of the majority of places where COMB, OBSE, STEA, and TACT were
      used raw in the code!
   -- Cleaned up NotifySpell so it's generic.
   -- Items now have a max_inventory value.  This lets us ensure no more than
      one balrog per unit nicely, and we can limit arbitrary items if we want.
   -- The monster escape code is now much more generic.  Still not 100% great
      but better than it was!
   -- Lots of uses of I_LEADER replaced with a type flag IT_LEADER.  There
      are still some, but the groundwork for multiple leader races is getting
      there.
   -- Changed USE_PREPARE slightly.  There is now a 'strict' and a 'normal'
      setting for USE_PREPARE.  Under strict, the READY command MUST be
      used or the unit will not use any battle items.  Under normal, the
      unit will fall back on the battle items list.
   -- gamedefs OCEAN and CONTINENT_SIZE now determine surface level parameters.
   -- Fixed a bug which caused the first mage casting Earth Lore in a
      region to recieve 2*level less silver than he should.
   -- Fixed a bug where an army where all casualties were healed were
      prevented from further moves or attacks.  Full healing should mean
      no penalties.
   -- Fixed a bug in output of rules dealing with skill-based maintenance.
   -- Fixed a bug dealing with the cost of non-skilled units versus skilled
      units when in a maintenance mode which requires skill based upkeep.
      Units will now pay the maximum of the skill based upkeep or the normal
      upkeep.  This means that GM's should probably *lower* the normal upkeep
      to something more reasonable than 10/20 if they are using the skill
      based upkeep unless they JUST want to penalize higher skilled leaders.
   -- Fixed bug where completed buildings weren't providing combat protection.
   -- Add some additional information to battle reports to help out the
      author of atlaclient.
   -- Fixed a bug where issuing a build order and an enter order on the same
      turn caused you to be in the wrong building and thus fail to build.
   -- Fixed bug in construct gate which made it successful 100% of the time
      at level 1, instead of 20% at level 1 up to 100% at level 5.
   -- Fixed bug where @endturn failed to work.
   -- Fixed another bug in skill based maintenance.
   -- Calls to CleanUpWater() and SeverLandBridges() now part of the default
      surface level creation. Also added some variability in terrain growth
      and some code to prevent land from squeezing onto the north and south
      map edges.
   -- Added an option to limit tact-5 leaders based on the number of points
      spent on war.
   -- Added coracles.
   -- CleanUpWater() now uses recursive calls to CheckSea() and is configurable
      via SEA_LIMIT. Added SEVER_LAND_BRIDGES gamedef to control severing
      behaviour.
   -- Added TERRAIN_GRANULARITY gamedef that controls variability in terrain
      distribution.
   -- Added another variant: Fracas!
   -- Added in an option to put varying bullet points in front of units 
      (was one of the TODO items)
   -- Added in flags to individually turn off the ability to study, teach 
      or gain experience in a skill (another one of the TODO items, requested 
      for Ceran)
   -- Option to create surface level with a fractal algorithm. A new GeoMap
      class was implemented to handle the generation of fractal geographical
      maps for world creation. Gamedefs FRACTAL_MAP, FRACTAL_SCATTER and
      FRACTAL_SMOOTH govern this method of map generation
   -- Fix bug in ARegion destructor  
   -- Added code to generate Icosahedral (ie, approximately spherical)
      levels.  Cleaned up some direction handling and some assumptions
      about there always being a region where you expected one to be.
   -- Fixed bug in CheckSea() where left of D_NORTH gave you D_NORTHEAST.
   -- created map.cpp in the gameset directory and moved world creation code
      from aregion.cpp to map.cpp to allow for game specific setup routines
   -- removed FRACTAL_... gamedefs - these things are now handled by game
      specific code in map.cpp
