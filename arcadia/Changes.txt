Hi all,

The Arcadia IV testgame is taking registrations. It will run three turns a week; details on order/times submission will come with the first turn, most likely to run Friday the 25th or Monday the 28th. Anyone may sign up; the format is meant to be cooperative rather than competitive - the game is there to find bugs and give people an opportunity to see the changes in the Arcadia series, not to win. The wishskill / wishdraw orders will be enabled.

Registration page is at http://nic-nac-project.de/~aeiou/.

There is currently no updated set of rules for Arcadia IV; all the changes from Arcadia III are listed following this message. I will attempt to write the rules documentation for Arcadia IV soon, but it may not be ready for the testgame. The rules for Arcadia III may be found at http://home.arcor.de/oidipus/game3/rules.html.

The changes for Arcadia IV are much less significant for gameplay than those from Arcadia II to Arcadia III, but nonetheless there are quite a few. Hopefully some (notably share, template/type and send) will make order writing significantly easier.

-Bradley, one of three Arcadia GMs - with Piotr & Patrick.


List of Changes for Arcadia IV:

Table of races changed: (5 human, 5 dwarf, 5 elf, 2 other)

Humans: raiders, barbarians, eskimos, nomads, tribesmen
Elves: ancient elves, wood elves, sea elves, high elves, tribal elves
Dwarves: plains dwarves, ice dwarves, hill dwarves, under dwarves, desert dwarves
Others: mermen, orcs

Maximum skill levels (specialist / non-specialist skills) for units are:
4/2 for normal units
6/4 for leaders
8/6 for heros
6/4 for heros studying hero/magic skills

Orders added:
SHARE (sets flag 'sharing' on/off)
SEND  (sends goods to nearby regions)
COMMAND (takes command of faction)
TEMPLATE (stores a set of orders under given name (eg TEMPLATE Scout) )
TYPE (applies a set of stored orders to the given unit, eg TYPE Scout)
LABEL (adds a label to a unit that only the owner can see)
ALL (issues orders to all units with the specified label)
SPOILS: SWIM & SAIL added
DISABLE (disables/re-enables an unwanted skill, eg summon wind)

Orders removed:
GIVEIF
RECRUIT


HEROS:
Mages are renamed heros
Leaders become leaders by studying leadership ($50); heros become heros when a leader studies heroship ($100). Leaders / heros retain their race characteristics.
Hero/Mage specialities are innate, depending on the unit's race (eg barbarian or wood elf).
Wandering mages no longer exist.
Energy costs no longer depend on race/speciality, though experience gained still does.
Energy is gained from the five base magic skills: Patterning, Mysticism, Winkey, Summoning and Artifact Lore. Battletraining and Charisma do not produce energy; nor do spells in those trees require energy.
There is now no hard limit on how many spells a mage may cast per month.
A mage may not cast a particular spell more than once per month.
Second, third etc. spells no longer cost extra energy to cast.
New magic tree.
Heros can execute a study order AND another monthlong order (other than study) in one turn.
Heros may not assassinate other heros.
Magic shields gain a +1 bonus in combat, ie an energy shield at level 1 now functions as it used to at level 2. Force shield is unchanged.
Energy recharge rate listed in reports

ALIGNMENTS:
Factions take on one of four alignments: Human, Elven, Dwarven, or Independent, depending on the race of their commanding unit (who must be a hero).
Alignment of factions marked in reports if unit's faction is identified.
Maintenance cost of units of the same ethnicity as the faction alignment are: 10,20,100 silver for normal, leader and hero units.
Maintenance cost of units of different ethnicity as the faction alignment are: 20,40,200 silver for normal, leader and hero units.
If the commander of a faction is killed during a month, the faction alignment will be set to "chaotic" AFTER the next maintenance phase. It may be reset at the beginning of next month by appointing a new commander.
If an army comprises mixed ethnicities, each man in the army receives (on average) a combat penalty of 2(1-f) to his attack and melee defence skills. f = the fraction of the army of the SAME ethnicity as the soldier. An average penalty of 0.3 would mean a 30% chance of a -1 penalty and a 70% chance of no penalty. This effect may be halved with the hero skill "unity".
Elves do not suffer from penalties to ranged attacks (in forests/jungles)
Four guardfactions, one of each alignment. Guardfactions are unfriendly to factions of different alignment.

MISCELLANEOUS:
New armour table (only minor changes from Arc III)
Item sharing implemented for EXCHANGE, SEND, STUDY, PRODUCE, BUILD, BUY (Not yet for SELL).
Guard regeneration halved from Arc III, still depends on city untaxed income.
Some guards will be equipped with crossbows or longbows.
Bridge cost reduced to 40 / skill 3.
Units transiting through a region will recieve a report on the region (not including units in the region).
Ranged attacks get +1 bonus in oceans and deserts
Populations multiplied by 20 (no economy change)
Units that have some swimming capacity, but weigh more than their capacity, will discard items (from heaviest to lightest, including non-swimming men) until they can swim, instead of drowning (though if there are no mermen in the unit, this may currently result in discarding all men).
Spoils order modified so that, for example, spoils ride allows a unit to pick up items until picking up any more would prevent them riding. Also, two new spoils options (swim, sail) added.
Disabling or forgetting a hero's combat spell sets their combat spell to 'none'.
Order checks do not return submitted orders; only errors.
Towers, forts, etc. have different defences, ranging from a +2 bonus (tower) to a +4 bonus (magical fortress). Forts and Citadels have greater defence bonuses for non-melee attacks (+3/+4) than for melee attacks (+2/+3).
Number of trade items reduced to 12 (from 19)
Unit 'labels' listed in reports (for ALL/LABEL orders)
Flying unit move-8 bug fixed
Using an ! before an order will suppress run-time errors in most cases other than DESTROY, TAX, PILLAGE, ENTER, LEAVE, GUARD.
PROMOTE works in open.
