Modificatons I've made to 4.0.4:

* Included the "Faction Number" fix from DejaNews
  This entails adding the faction number to the name of the faction
  when the faction is first created, thereby ensuring it is part
  of the "players.out" file.

* Added two new tokens to the "players.in" file:
  "RewardTimes" -- gives the times reward to the faction.  this
                   replaces the Times reward section in PreProcessTurn.
  "SendTimes [0|1]" -- tells external tools whether the faction wishes
                       to receive the Times.

* As mentioned, modified the PreProcessTurn() so it does not automatically
  grant the Times reward.
