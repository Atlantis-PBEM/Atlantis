<h3>Atlantis New Origins #2: Dawn of </h3>

<p>
  The Great Enemy, Devourer has been slain hundreds years ago.

  Voids changed shape of the world and people from the past would not recognize Atlantis nowadays.
  Atlantis world survived but was heavily damaged by Voids and Voidborn creatures.

  People will never forget those heroes who stopped great Evil and saved Atlantis.

  You found yourself in a weird place called Nexus, place between worlds,
  surrounded by others like you. Six Gates stand open before you, choose one or push your 
  luck and use magic to teleport somewhere randomly.
</p>

<p>
  With your powers you can perhaps find followers and build a place to live...
</p>

  There are some rumors that after Devourer's death, Artifacts of Power were shattered around the world. 
  You can try to follow their trails completing quests and maybe find some?
</p>
