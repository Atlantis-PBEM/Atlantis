Skill reports:

observation [OBSE] 1: A unit with this skill can see stealthy units or
  monsters whose stealth rating is less than or equal to the observing
  unit's Observation level. The unit can also determine the faction
  owning a unit, provided its Observation level is higher than the
  other unit's Stealth level. This skill costs 50 silver per month of
  study.

force [FORC] 1: The Force skill is not directly useful to a mage, but
  is rather one of the Foundation skills on which other magical skills
  are based. The Force skill determines the power of the magical
  energy that a mage is able to use. Note that a Force skill level of
  0 does not indicate that a mage cannot use magical energy, but
  rather can only perform magical acts that do not require great
  amounts of power. This skill costs 100 silver per month of study.

pattern [PATT] 1: The Pattern skill is not directly useful to a mage,
  but is rather one of the Foundation skills on which other magical
  skills are based. A mage's Pattern skill indicates the ability to
  handle complex magical patterns, and is important for complicated
  tasks such as healing and controlling nature. This skill costs 100
  silver per month of study.

spirit [SPIR] 1: The Spirit skill is not directly useful to a mage,
  but is rather one of the Foundation skills on which other magical
  skills are based. Spirit skill indicates the mage's ability to
  control and affect magic and other powers beyond the material world.
  This skill costs 100 silver per month of study.

gate lore [GATE] 1: Gate Lore is the art of detecting and using
  magical Gates, which are spread through the world. The Gates are
  spread out randomly, so there is no correlation between the Gate
  number and the Gate's location. A mage with skill 1 in Gate Lore can
  see a Gate if one exists in the same region as the mage. This
  detection is automatic; the Gate will appear in the region report. A
  mage with skill 1 in Gate Lore may also jump through a Gate into
  another region on the same level containing a gate, selected at
  random. To use Gate Lore in this manner, use the syntax CAST
  Gate_Lore RANDOM UNITS <unit> ... UNITS is followed by a list of
  units to follow the mage through the Gate (the mage always jumps
  through the Gate). At level 1, the mage may carry 15 weight units
  through the Gate (including the weight of the mage). This skill
  requires pattern [PATT] 1 and spirit [SPIR] 1 to begin to study.
  This skill costs 100 silver per month of study.

fire [FIRE] 1:  A mage with this skill can cast a fireball in battle.
  This ability does between 2 and 10 times the skill level of the mage
  energy attacks and each attack deals 1 damage. In order to use this
  spell in combat, the mage should use the COMBAT order to set it as
  his combat spell. This skill requires force [FORC] 1 to begin to
  study. This skill costs 100 silver per month of study.

combat [COMB] 1: This skill gives the unit a bonus in hand to hand
  combat. Also, a unit with this skill may TAX or PILLAGE. This skill
  costs 10 silver per month of study.

combat [COMB] 2: No skill report.

combat [COMB] 3: No skill report.
