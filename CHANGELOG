Changes from 4.0.5 -> 4.0.6
--------------------------------------------------
   -- Added FIND ALL command supplied by Tzarg (Tom Alsen)
   -- Reworked enabling/disabling of items to better preserve old feel.
   -- Various small bugfixes.
   -- Added worldname to the gamedefs structure (used for creating the
      names for the nexus and oceans as well as some spell texts)
   -- Added NEXUS_GATE gamedef to allow a one-way gate directly out of the
      nexus via gate lore.   There is no actual gate so people cannot in
      fact return to the nexus once leaving.
   -- Added code to make a starting city into just a rich city (with
      limited items available) if the city guards are taken out when
      SAFE_START_CITIES is false.   Once this occurs the unlimited goods
      are gone for good.
   -- Added MORE_PROFITABLE_TRADE_GOODS option to gamedefs.   If this is
      enabled the selling price for a trade good in a city ranges from 60-114
      and the price a city will pay ranges from 150-210.   If it is not
      enabled, the price ranges from 60-90 for selling and from 90-120 for
      buying.  This option is not on by default.
   -- Added quite a few options to help Georg Gottschalk with Ceran
   -- Added more ceran things to support Georg
   -- Fixed a bug whereby a unit which studied a mage skill but failed to
      study due to insufficient funds was still marked (and counted) as a
      mage.
   -- Fixed a bug that allowed units apprentices to become mages and vice
      versa without needing to FORGET first.
   -- Guarding units see who they forbid entry too.
   -- A unit forbidden entry (or the guarding unit) will see the faction of
      the unit that forbid them (or that they forbid) if they have sufficient
      observation of if the unit is revealing faction.
   -- Added BATTLE_FACTION_INFO option in gamedefs.   If this is true, then
      units involved in a battle will display their faction information IF
      *ANY* unit on the opposite side has sufficent OBSE to see it.   The
      reason this is an option (unlike the guarding units one) is that the
      same battle report is sent to non-involved observers of the battle.
      Due to the way the battle information is stored, it is not possible to
      customize this info per-faction seeing.
   -- Fixed a bug where a failed build incremented the building sequence
      number leading to a method whereby a region could be made deliberately
      unusable for building.
   -- Increased the range on the days of skill so that it shouldn't wrap
      to negatives.  Overflow sucks.
   -- Changed the message when no spoils are gained in a battle to
      'Spoils: none.' to alleviate problems with clients that didn't bother
      to figure out that the message used to be 'No spoils'.  Besides, a
      consistant format is good.
   -- Implemented WITHDRAW order, making unlimited markets unnecessary.
      This order is not enabled by default (enable via ALLOW_WITHDRAW in
      gamedefs.h).   If this option is enabled, the world building code will
      not build unlimited markets in the starting city, but will build regular
      markets instead.
