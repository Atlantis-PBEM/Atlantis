Changes from 4.0.4 -> 4.0.5
-------------------------------------------------
   -- Merged 4.0.4c and Realms of Arcane Codebases
   -- Merged in some parts of Lacandon conquest
   -- Fairly extensive reorganization of the source code.
   -- Small fix to make discontinuities in the UW maze less.
   -- Added ability to disable items.
   -- Some changes for Wyreth
   -- Changes for greater flexibility
   -- Many new options in gamedefs structure.

Changes from 4.0.5 -> 4.0.6
--------------------------------------------------
   -- Added FIND ALL command supplied by Tzarg (Tom)
   -- Reworked enabling/disabling of items to better preserve old feel.
   -- Various small bugfixes.
   -- Added worldname to the gamedefs structure (used for creating the
      names for the nexus and oceans as well as some spell texts)
   -- Added NEXUS_GATE gamedef to allow a one-way gate directly out of the
      nexus via gate lore.   There is no actual gate so people cannot in
      fact return to the nexus once leaving.
   -- Added code to make a starting city into just a rich city (with
      limited items available) if the city guards are taken out when
      SAFE_START_CITIES is false.   Once this occurs the unlimited goods
      are gone for good.
