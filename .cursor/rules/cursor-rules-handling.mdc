# Cursor Rules Overview

The rules in the `.cursor/rules` directory are to guide the agent to assist me better.  In order to do that, organizing them is the first step.

## File Structure

The content of each rule `.mdc` file contains inforamation as follows:

### Frontmatter
- A front-matter block which must be formatted in the following manner:
  - At most one of `alwaysApply`, `globs` or `description` should be enabled.
  - When `alwaysApply` is enabled, it's value should be `true`.  When not enabled, it's value should be `false`.
  - `globs` and `description` should be empty if not enabled or have a value if enabled.
  - The descripton, if provided MUST be useful to the agent, and is meant for the agent, not the user.
- The frontmatter should always have the following structure
  ```mdc
  ---
  description: USE WHEN <verb in active tense> <action>
  globs: <comma seperated list of file globs>
  alwaysApply: <boolean>
  ---
  ```
- Here are examples of properly formatted frontmatter for different conditions:
  1. A rule which is always supposed to apply
    ```mdc
    ---
    desription:
    globs:
    alwaysApply: true
    ---
    ```
  2. A rule which only applies to all c++ filetypes
    ```mdc
    ---
    description:
    globs: **/*.cpp, **/*.hpp, **/*.h, **/*.inl
    alwaysApply: false
    ```
  3. A rule which only applies in specific circumstances
    ```mdc
    ---
    description: USE WHEN creating or modifying unit tests
    globs:
    alwaysApply: false
    ```
  4. A rule which will only be included if referenced directly
     ```mdc
     ---
     description:
     globs:
     alwaysApply: false
     ```

## Rule content

The remainder of the file must be properly formatted markdown.

### Rule structure
- Organize the markdown logically.
- Provide examples when necessary.
- Keep instructions actionable and concise.

## File Naming And Organization

- Files must be named in kebab-case with a concise descriptive name that accurately describes it.
- Files related to a single topic should be groups in subdirectories
- Files must be kept short and focused.

## File Creation, Editing and Upkeep

- When creating a rule:
  - Using your internal tools.
  - Inform the user how the metadata should be set
    - the internal tools does not correctly create the frontmatter
- When editing or updating a rule:
  - Use your internal tools.
  - Inform the user if the metadata needs to be updated.
    - The internal tool does not correctly see the frontmatter
- When reorganizing rules:
  - Maintain a good organizations structure.
  - Suggest reorganizing the structure as needed.
