  The old king Rodric is dead, foully murdered by his evil brother. 
  The land has been plunged into chaos and civil war these past fifty years,
  as one noble after another waged petty war upon his neighbor, hoping to
  regain the crown that was lost so many years ago.

  Now it is your turn. Reunite the kingdoms once more, and the bards will sing
  of your exploits for years to come. Restore the land, rebuild the fortifications
  that were once proud and strong, and recover the skills and magical knowledge
  brutally suppressed by years of famine, strife and torment. Lead the people into 
  a new golden age.
</P>
<P>
  Fail, and you will be yet another millstone around the neck of your people.
