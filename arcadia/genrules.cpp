	temp += "A: Max Shariy has written a program called Atlantis Little Helper, which is "
	        "compatible with the Nylandor version of Atlantis. It is available from "
	        "http://members.shaw.ca/mshariy/ah.html. There are a number of other clients "
	        "written for Atlantis games in general, but they will not support all the "
	        "features of Nylandor. There are some minor details in ALH which are set to "
            "the default values of Atlantis games, rather than Nylandor. Namely, "
            "the weights "
            "and capacities of some monsters (including dragons and balrogs) have been "
            "changed, and pearls are no longer a trade good.";

	temp = "Q: If a unit has a horse but no riding skill, can he ride?<br></br>";
	temp += "A: The riding skill only affects combat, so out of combat, he can ride. However, "
            "he will not be able to use the horse to ride in combat.";
    f.Paragraph(temp);
    
	temp = "Q: My unit has Capacity: 0/40/100/0. What do all the numbers mean? <br></br>";
	temp += "A: The first number is the total weight the unit can fly with. If the unit weighs more "
            "than this, it will not be able to fly. The second is for riding movement, and the third "
            "for walking movement. Thus, if the unit in question has a weight of 40 or less, it will "
            "ride when given the MOVE or ADVANCE order. However, if it weighs 60, it will walk, and if it weighs "
            "101 or more, it will not be able to move. The fourth number listed is 'swimming' capacity, "
            "which allows units to travel across an ocean without a boat. In almost all instances, this "
            "number will be zero.";
    f.Paragraph(temp);

	temp = "Q: If my unit has reached its maximum knowledge level, can it still study? <br></br>";
	temp += "A: Yes. Further study will provide the same experience as using the skill normally; "
            "this is usually 10, but will be less if the unit does not specialise in that skill "
            "(leaders are counted as specialising in all non-magic skills). However, it would "
            "obviously be better for the unit to get practise for real, so that you do not have "
            "to pay study costs.";
    f.Paragraph(temp);

	temp = "Q: If something doesn't make sense, where do I go for help? <br></br>";
	temp += "A: Ask on the game's yahoogroup. If you are playing, you should have already signed "
            "up, but the address is http://groups.yahoo.com/group/arcadia-pbm/ just in case.";
    f.Paragraph(temp);

	temp = "Q: Do I have to submit times articles? <br></br>";
	temp += "A: No, but it is strongly requested. The times is the main place for roleplay and "
            "interaction between players. The Arcadia series of Atlantis was begun as an attempt "
            "to get away from the 'big-game' sydnrome of having many players who do not know each "
            "other, and interact only through their units. By storytelling in the times, everyone "
            "benefits from the creation of a world with many facets.";
    f.Paragraph(temp);

	temp = "Q: My mage never has enough energy to cast spells. What should I do? <br></br>";
	temp += "A: Magic skills can be split into two sections - the foundations, and the spells. "
            "Studying spells gives you more choices as to what to cast. Studying foundations gives "
            "your mage more energy with which to cast them. The skill 'inner strength' also helps "
            "increase a mage's energy, though it is not technically a foundation skill. If you find "
            "you have more energy than you are using, study some more spells. Remember, you can "
            "cast as many spells as you like per turn, plus use other spells in battle, as long "
            "as you have sufficient energy.";
    f.Paragraph(temp);

	temp = "Q: After years of studying I finally got a staff of fire. But my mage keeps casting storms instead! <br></br>";
	temp += "A: Your mage will use his 'combat' spell (set with the COMBAT order) in battle. He will only use battle items, "
            "such as a staff of fire or lightning, if he has no COMBAT spell set. To clear your combat spell, issue "
            "the order 'COMBAT' with no arguments.";
    f.Paragraph(temp);

	temp = "Q: I cast a ranged spell and specified the region it was to be cast in, but I got the error message 'No region specified'. <br></br>";
	temp += "A: Pay close attention to the spell template. If it has the word REGION, UNIT, UNITS, DIRECTION, or similar "
            "present, then those words must be used when writing the order. For instance, the spell "
            "description for farsight may say to use the format 'CAST Farsight REGION <x> <y> <z>'. With "
            "this template, one possible cast order would be 'CAST Farsight REGION 5 7 1'. The order 'CAST "
            "Farsight 5 7 1' will NOT work.";
    f.Paragraph(temp);

	temp = "Q: Do I have to use the full spell name when casting? <br></br>";
	temp += "A: No, the abbrevation will work as well. For instance, 'CAST Bird_Lore DIRECTION NE' and "
            "'CAST BIRD DIRECTION NE' do exactly the same thing. Also, for spells which require "
            "a region to be specified, not specifying a region will cause the spell to default to "
            "the mage's current location (eg 'CAST Blizzard' will cause a blizzard to be cast "
            "on the mage's current location).";
    f.Paragraph(temp);

	temp = "Q: Is there any way to reduce the amount of orders I have to write? <br></br>";
	temp += "A: Yes and no. The '@' and 'TURN/ENDTURN' commands are very useful in reducing "
            "order writing, as are the TYPE, TEMPLATE and SHARE commands. Also, fine setting "
            "of spoils flags before a battle can often save a lot more time after the battle, "
            "not having to transfer your spoils from lots of different units. "
            "For instance, if you want a unit to cast earthlore every turn, use the order "
            "@CAST Earth_Lore, which will cause the order to be included into your orders "
            "template for next turn. Then write your next orders based on your order template "
            "(if you are using ALH to write orders, it will do this automatically). If you "

            "at sea, and an enemy can always sail into the hex. Of course, if you set them hostile "
            "you will attack them as soon as they do so. Ships sailing along rivers can be stopped "

	temp += "A: All spell costs are worked out on a per man basis, but the skill description "
	        "may not reflect this in order to give you are more accurate measure of the cost for "
	        "casting on multiple men. In this case, the cost for one man would be 10/4 = 2.5, rounded "

	temp += "A: No. Arcadia is based on Atlantis V5, which is now close to bug-free. However, there have been many "
            "modifications made for the Arcadia series, and while testing has been done to reduce the number of bugs, there "
            "are certainly some remaining. If you become aware of a bug in the program (either harmful OR beneficial) please "
            "let your GM know about it, and it will be fixed as soon as possible. In serious "
            "cases the gamefile may be modified to remove the result of the bug, or the turn "
            "may be rerun. The existance of bugs (hopefully rare) is the price "
            "players pay for playing in games with dynamic rules - which are, we like "
            "to believe, superior to the original.";
    f.Paragraph(temp);
    
	temp = "Q: If two mages both have fog as their combat spell, will they both cast it? <br></br>";
	temp += "A: No. There are a few combat spells which are not cumulative - these include fog, darkness, "
            "concealment, and their counter-spells. To save energy, only the best skilled mage from each army will cast "
            "these spells in combat; however if this mage runs out of energy, then the second mage "
            "will cast instead. " /*Note though, that if the spell fizzles, the second mage will not attempt "
            "to cast during that combat round. */ "Shield spells do not follow this pattern - multiple shields may "

    f.Paragraph(temp);

	temp = "Q: If my mage is set to cast 'banish demons', but there are no demons present, what happens? <br></br>";
	temp += "A: The mage will realise that his spell will do nothing, and will not cast it. This saves his "
            "energy, but also means he is not going to get much battle experience in the spell. "
            "This applies to all offensive spells which only target certain creatures; if they cannot hit "
            "anyone, they will not get cast.";
    f.Paragraph(temp);
    
	temp = "Q: I am having trouble with TEACH and BUILD orders for units on ships. What's going on? <br></br>";
	temp += "A: Unit aliases (such as 'NEW 1') are cleared whenever a unit moves from its original hex. "
            "Because SAIL takes place before TEACH orders, this means that if a 'NEW' unit sails, any "
            "attempt to teach it (such as TEACH NEW 1) will fail. This only applies to newly formed units, "
            "and unfortunately there is not yet a way around it. Additionally, although BUILD orders are "
            "processed after SAIL orders, any unit which is on a moving ship and attempts to BUILD will "
            "fail his order. This is a side-effect of the way in which BUILD orders are processed, and cannot be avoided."
            "If you intended the structure to be built in the region the ship is leaving, then you should "
            "give the unit a LEAVE or ENTER order in addition to the BUILD order. If you wanted to BUILD "
            "a structure in the region the ship is sailing to, you must wait until the next month, when your "
            "builders can disembark and BUILD a structure.";

   	temp = "Q: What riding skill do monsters have? <br></br>";
	temp += "A: When trying to catch a monster to initiate a battle, the monster will have an effective riding "
            "skill of 4 if it flies, 2 if it rides, or 0 if it can only walk or swim. However, when the monster "

           " higher skill levels. How do I know how much it will be? <br></br>";
	temp += "A: The cost quoted is accurate at skill level 1. Every level above this reduces the cost by 10%, so the "
            "maintenance will be 90% of the quoted value at level 2, down to 50% at level 6. Note that if the maintenance "

	temp = "Q: What determines the rate at which a settlement grows? <br></br>";
	temp += "A: Settlements (villages, towns and cities) will stay at their initial population until someone "
            "produces, buys or sells in the region. Producing in the region can change the population "
            "slightly; this occurs equally in all regions regardless of the presence of a settlement. "
            "Buying and selling items can make a big difference to the population of the settlement. "
            "Generally, there is a mimimum amount that must be traded before the settlement will grow "
            "at all, and every additional bit will help it to grow more. But there is also a maximum rate "
            "at which a settlement will grow, so there is no point selling more than two to three times "
            "the minimum amount needed. For all growth calculations, selling a food item has double the "
            "effect of selling a non-food item (such as stone), and trade items count triple when bought "
            "or sold. If trade in the settlement stops, the population will gradually "
            "decline over time, but will never fall below 80% of the biggest size the settlement reached. "
            "Also, settlements which demand few foodstuffs (grain, livestock and fish) are easier to grow than "
            "a settlement of the same size that demands more foodstuffs.";
    f.Paragraph(temp);
    
   	temp = "Q: What is the exact equation for growth of a settlement? <br></br>";

            "plus the total demand and availability of trade items, multiplied by 3. "
            "Let t be the total trade occuring in the settlement, given by the sum of all normal trades, "
            "plus 2 times all food trades, plus 3 times all trades of 'trade items'. Let P be the population "
            "of the settlement (this is slightly less than the total population of the region). Define M as "
            "'P/120000 - 0.08'. If t < MT, the settlement will lose population equal to (P-Pt/MT)/20, but will "
            "not drop below 80% of the greatest size the settlement has previously reached. If t > MT, the "
            "city will grow by G*(1- exp(1-(t/MT)) ), where G is '3000 + P(120000-P)/24000000'.";

	temp += "Spell damages are generated randomly, so will always be different. However, "
            "we can work out some averages for a particular spell. Summon tornado is quoted "
            "as getting 2-100*lvl chances-to-attack. That is, at level 2 it gets 2-200 "
            "chances-to-attack, or 101 on average. In most terrains, each chance to attack "
            "has a 50% success rate, so he will on average make 50.5 attacks. In forests "
            "or jungles, ranged and magic attacks suffer a -1 penalty, so the mage will "
            "make 101/3 = 33.7 attacks on average. <br></br> " 
            "Each attack is a 'weather' attack made with skill 2. Men in the open defend "
            "against magic attacks with skill 0, ie at a penalty of -2 relative to the "
            "casting mage. Each attack thus has a 4:1, ie 80% chance of killing a man "
            "in the open. Thus, this spell will, on average, kill about 40 men in most "
            "terrains. In forests or jungles, the mage suffers a -1 skill penalty, so "
            "only gets a 2:1, or 67% success rate for his 33.7 attacks, and will thus "
            "kill about 22 men. <br></br> "
            "Some creatures have a higher defence against weather attacks; for instance "
            "skeletons have a defence of 3. Against an all-skeleton army, this mage "
            "would (in normal terrain) have a 1:2 success rate, ie 33%, and would kill"
            "about 50.5/3 ~ 17 skeletons. Men in towers get a +2 bonus "
            "to magic defence (more if it has runewords or larger buildings), as well as the caster getting "
            "a -1 penalty to chance-to-attack. So if the men in the previous example "
