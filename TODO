   -- GIVE ALL TRADE (to give away all trade goods) (other categories for
      other obvious flags) (maybe.. there are issues with this)
   -- BUY ALL/SELL ALL
   -- Improve the item/hex editor
   -- Gamedef to handle various options around combat/weapons/bows for taxing
   -- Gamedefs for various economy options. (far future)
   -- Give more information when SHOW <item> is done.
   -- Add option to allow towers/forts/etc to allow training only a certain
      number of mages.
   -- Consider more complicated GIVE processing of 'GIVE ALL EXCEPT .....'
   -- Consider requiring both food and pay for upkeep (make upkeep more
      flexible in general).  Someone supplied a patch to allow a leader to
      only eat 1 (grain/livestock/fish) instead of 1 per 10 SILV upkeep.
      That would be a nice option to support as well, but to do so (as well)
      as allow old behaviour requires flexibility.
   -- Merchent skill (limited number of merchents)/Limited number
      of tacticians/generals?
   -- Make errors for overwriting orders ONLY be an error if overwriting a
      NON-@ order.
   -- Find some way to allow multiple factions starting a build on the same
      turn to help.
   -- Consider some sorts of dangers for production
   -- Consider having artifact spells require physical components rather than
      merely money.
   -- Increase number of products possible per terrain type from 5 to 7?
   -- Consider a gamedef which keeps tactics skill (and combat skills?)
      hidden from combatants.  (I personally think this a bad idea, but it
      was suggested, thus goes on this list)
   -- Consider hiding battle details from units which are completely wiped
      out?  [You know a battle occured, but no details of the enemy forces].
      Again, I suspect rumors travel (ie, the peasants in the area that saw
      the battle talk and the word of their strenght spreads).   Given that
      generating *inaccurate* reports would be a royal pain, I will probably
      leave this be.
   -- Consider allowing luxury food items (chocolate, vodka, cavier) to be
      able to be eaten.  Again, don't think this is a good idea, but will
      at least think on it.
   -- Tune the amounts of new resources
   -- Add underdeep changes from Georg (make underdeep specific terrain as well)
   -- Consider adding the ability to produce trade goods.
   -- Consider Duergar's war horses
   -- Consider building specific skills.
   -- Consider non-teachable skills.
   -- Consider having use'd items.
   -- Need a tool which given template files and globals structures can
      build an accurate rules set.
